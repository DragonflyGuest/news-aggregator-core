        "article_text": "Andrey_Popov/Shutterstock There’s a paradox about the way we respond to threats to the cost of living. On one hand, governments put in place subsidies for things such as rent and  electricity, as the federal government did in this year’s budget . On the other hand, we get told these subsidies are inflationary because they put more free cash in the hands of consumers. At the same time, when the cost of living climbs enough to push inflation beyond the Reserve Bank’s target, the bank pushes up interest rates in an attempt to drive measured inflation down. For mortgage holders, this often pushes up payments. which aren’t included in the standard measure of inflation but nevertheless add to their cost of living. By themselves, higher prices aren’t a problem Although we often talk about the cost of living as a problem, by itself it shouldn’t bother us much. The cost of living, as measured by the amount needed to meet basic needs, has been climbing steadily for at least a century. In the famous Harvester judgment of 1907 , Justice Henry Higgins determined that a “living wage” for a family of five was 42 shillings ($4.20) per week. So much has the cost of living climbed that these days that can barely buy a cup of coffee. A loaf of bread cost four pennies then, and these days costs 100 times as much . Yet no one doubts that the typical family is better off today even though the cost of living has climbed. The reason, of course, is that incomes have climbed faster than prices for most of the past century. Average weekly ordinary time earnings are now nearly $2,000 a week , 500 times higher than in 1907. What matters is not prices, but the purchasing power of our disposable incomes (which are incomes after the payment of taxes, interest and unavoidable costs). Just recently, and unusually, wage growth has been lagging behind price growth. In 2022, the year in which inflation peaked, consumer prices climbed 7.8% while wages grew 3.3% . The 2022 increase in prices wasn’t at all extreme by historical standards. Prices climbed faster in the 1970s and 1980s without producing a “cost of living crisis”. But back then, during much of the 1970s and 1980s, wages were indexed to prices, meaning they kept pace. As a result, increases in the cost of living didn’t worry us as much. Sharp interest rate increases are a problem The response of the Reserve Bank and other central banks to the inflation shock of 2022 was to rapidly and repeatedly lift the interest rates they influence, the so-called cash rate in Australia’s case, in order to drive inflation back to target. It is important to observe that no theoretical rationale for Australia’s inflation target has ever been put forward. Both the idea of targeting consumer price inflation and the choice of the 2–3% target band are arbitrary. They were inherited from the very different circumstances of the early 1990s and the judgment call of a right-wing New Zealand finance minister. The recent review of the Reserve Bank acknowledged the challenges to this orthodoxy but didn’t consider them. A more fundamental problem, which hasn’t been properly analysed, is the relationship between high rates and the purchasing power of disposable incomes. Higher rates benefit some, hurt others Interest payments are a deduction from disposable income for households with mortgage debt (mostly, but not exclusively, young)  and a source of income for those with net financial wealth (mostly, but not exclusively, old). The result is a largely random redistribution of the effects of increasing interest rates. It’s perceived by the losers as an increase in the cost of living, and by the winners as a windfall gain, enabling some luxury spending. I made this point about the limitations of using interest rates to contain inflation at a Reserve Bank conference in the late 1990s , but it had little impact at the time. Since interest rates remained largely stable around a slowly declining trend for the following two decades, the point was mostly of academic interest. Until now. The increase of about four percentage points in the Reserve Bank’s cash rate from 2022 is the first really large increase since the inflation target was adopted in the early 1990s. We are now seeing the consequences of using interest rates to target inflation, even if they are poorly understood. Fitting in with familiar narratives, the distributional consequences are framed in terms of intergenerational conflicts (Boomers versus Millennials) rather than the product of misconceived economic policy. If sharp increases in interest rates aren’t the right tool to control inflation, what is? The experience of the 1980s provides an idea. The best idea is to avoid income shocks Rather than seeking a rapid return of inflation to an arbitrary target band, we should  instead focus on avoiding large income shocks while bringing about a gradual decline in inflation. That would mean indexing wages to prices, and avoiding sharp shocks like the interest rate hikes in the late 1980s that gave us the “ recession we had to have ”. That’s unlikely to happen soon. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to try to avoid the traps inherent in talking about the “cost of living”, and be aware that in a world in which the actual cost of living includes interest rates, sharp increases in rates do little for many who are finding it hard to keep up.

        "article_text": "Much has been written about the success of women athletes at the 2024 Paris games, dubbed the first gender-equal Olympics with equal numbers of men and women competing. However, the situation for the Paralympic games is much less promising. Just 42% of athlete spots at the Paralympics will go to women (equal to the Tokyo games). At the non-elite level, the situation is even worse. In Australia, just 19% of women with disability are regularly involved in organised sport, compared to 34% of non-disabled women, and 27% of men with disability. With nine years to go until the 2032 Brisbane Paralympics, these participation numbers are a significant concern. Barriers for women with disabilities The Australian government has invested in Paralympics Australia to improve their talent identification and pathway programs. The goal is to build towards “Australia’s biggest ever team to achieve the nation’s best ever performance” in Brisbane 2032, according to minister for sport Anika Wells . However, to meet this goal, Australian sport needs to address the major issues with the pathways, development and elite programs that are currently failing women with disability. There are numerous reasons for this. Women with disability tend to have less support to engage with sport, as  many parents and medical professionals are highly protective and tend to underestimate their physical capabilities . Consequently, they are harder to identify using traditional talent search methods, particularly in sports that may be more physical or involve contact. In my ongoing research looking at the experiences of elite women para-athletes, one athlete revealed: It’s been really hard to find more female athletes to take up the sport because it is quite a physical and difficult sport. This is particularly true for women with high-support needs, who are even less likely to participate and are identified as a major gap in the Australian team. The issue is at all levels of sport The battle isn’t over when athletes get into the elite pathway. Women with disability are often coached by male, able-bodied coaches, who have minimal understanding of disability. This can have a significant impact. There are also concerns that women with disibility are more likely to receive inappropriate comments about their disability, gender or weight, or even sexual harassment from some male coaches . Participants in my study also identified a lack of knowledge and limited research about disability sport. One athlete said it’s “hard for [coaches or administrators] to set up [coaching] courses, say how to coach a para-athlete, when there’s not really much data.” This was a particularly issue for sportswomen who require specialised equipment like wheelchairs or prosthetics, who have to rely on trial and error in their design. Even national training facilities are not always accessible, respondents to my study identified, let alone grassroots facilities. Indeed, women with disabilities often face specific accessibility challenges that are not taken into account by male-dominated disability studies and design. For example, the design of accessible toilets to accommodate menstrual issues and catheterisation (if the athlete is unable to completely empty their bladders). Furthermore, while sport can be a place of inclusion and belonging, women with disability often experience bullying, anxiety, and exclusion, from coaches, administrators, and non-disabled parents and children. As one respondent in my study said: Most of us have been bullied somewhat or had rude or kind of mean comments. In particular, some women with disabilities will avoid sports in which their body will be on display . While the Paralympics may be a celebration of the diversity of bodies, at the lower levels, a more welcoming community must be developed to ensure a safe environment for women with disability. Next steps Key to creating a safe environment is the need to manage the mixed-gender training environments of many Paralympic sports. While 8% of quota spots in Paris are ostensibly gender-neutral, in reality, sports like wheelchair rugby are significantly male-dominated (though Australia has a record three women competing in wheelchair rugby at the Paris Paralympics). These sports are often not inclusive and haven’t adapted to ensure the safety of women. Furthermore, though sports like wheelchair basketball are segregated at the Paralympic level, junior programs have boys and girls competing together. This is often to the detriment of the development of girls. Training is often targeted to men, which one athlete suggested is a barrier: “I’m doing pretty much the same program as the para-men […] it’s quite hard to train together.” Despite these significant issues facing women with disability in sport, most sport organisations do not have specific plans as to how to address this gender gap. Instead, funding is often tied to one area of disadvantage (such as gender, disability, culture), without an understanding that people can have several disadvantages that need to be specifically addressed. For Australia to have its most successful Paralympic games ever, we need to start thinking now about how we can change sporting cultures to better include women with disability.

        "article_text": "The outcome of the referendum has been chalked up to deepening political polarisation , Australian’s entrenched racial prejudice and the rise of populism . In short, opposition to the Voice to Parliament has been characterised as a conservative populist backlash with racist undertones. In the wake of a 60/40 “no” vote majority, this message only serves to deepen the post-referendum divide. However, new research indicates the story is a little more complex. Findings show it was fundamentally the esteem of authority, the desire for an ordered society, and perceptions of justice and fairness that dictated how people engaged with this emotionally charged political issue, and ultimately how they voted. It is only by a greater understanding of people’s attitudes towards the referendum (even if we disagree with them) that Australians can move forward and have a more productive bipartisan conversation. Hierarchical status quo We collected survey data from 253 people before and after the referendum. We wanted to get an idea of the way people’s worldviews would influence their vote and opinions about the outcome of the referendum. In June 2023 (roughly 16 weeks before the vote) we asked about people’s attitudes towards authority, their opinion about social hierarchy, and their perceptions of justice in society. In October (immediately after the vote) we asked how people voted and whether they thought the outcome of the referendum would be good for Australia. Our findings show people who voted “no” and who were pleased with the outcome were more willing to submit to authority. They also preferred a hierarchical society where the social status of different groups is maintained. These attitudes were more important in predicting voting behaviour than a person’s age, gender, ethnicity, income, education, religion or even their political orientation. Whereas social hierarchy beliefs are broad and refer to a person’s general view that it’s a “dog-eat-dog” world, racism relates more narrowly to discrimination against people based on their ethnicity. While there’s often a complicated relationship between preference for social hierarchy and racism, these findings counter the widespread claims that those who voted “no” were entirely racially motivated or were simply voting along political lines. In understanding why some people voted “no”, these findings can promote a more open discussion. For example, in the future when discussing profound and potentially momentous changes to the country (the current debate around nuclear energy, for example), it will be helpful to remember that people differ drastically in their willingness to follow along with authority. Some will be quick to cotton on to messages from leaders and may act passionately (even aggressively) on these convictions. Others will be slower and more cautious in their support for ideas expressed by authority. It will also be helpful to remember people have different ideas about how society should be structured. Some people will prefer a society with a clear pecking order, perhaps fearing the chaos of a disordered society. Others are less concerned with a clear structure in favour of things like social mobility. Our findings show we shouldn’t reduce support for complex issues simply to one’s political orientation or demographic characteristics. We need to seek first to understand a person’s worldview and attitude towards societal change. Only then can we have a productive conversation about what is best for the country. Perceived (in)justice Populism is the idea that a small group of elite people are trying to force change on society. A populist backlash occurs when ordinary people rebel against the powerful minority and exert the popular will of the people. Voting down the referendum has been characterised in such terms. Our data show people who voted “no” view society as a just place in which people are generally treated fairly. They didn’t accept the fundamental premise on which the referendum was sold: that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are, and have been, unjustly treated. This finding provides a helpful insight into the populist explanation for the referendum outcome. At its heart, the populist narrative is a story of justice. The idea that the elite are pursuing their own agenda to the detriment of the people strikes us all as unjust. But it is people who already see society as a just and fair place who are especially sensitive to this perceived injustice. These people can act out in sometimes extreme ways. Consider, for example, the January 6 storming of the US capitol . By understanding the populist account in terms of justice, we can clearly see how the post-referendum divide in society has formed: those who voted “no” feel vindicated at having avoided an unjust change to society, while those who voted “yes” become wary of these people for their extreme and seemingly unwarranted reaction. Understanding not only the important role that justice plays in people’s lives, but also that people can have differing views of what justice is, is crucial to keep in mind. In a world where political polarisation is increasing and where we are confronted with news (some real, some fake) that continually seems to deepen this divide, taking the time to understand the complexity of people’s worldviews and political opinions – even those you might disagree with – is more important than ever.

        "article_text": "Papua New Guinea has had a difficult year, beginning with serious rioting and looting in the capital, Port Moresby, and several other towns. After a payroll glitch led to a stop-work action by police, the so-called Black Wednesday riots on January 10 resulted in burned-out stores and at least 20 deaths . In February, an inter-group conflict in the troubled Highlands province of Enga led to around 70 killings . And late last month, a marauding gang of young men calling themselves “I don’t care” terrorised rural villagers in East Sepik province. According to reports , at least 26 were killed, unconfirmed numbers of women and girls were raped and several homes were torched. It’s time for a fresh look at how and why these issues are boiling over, and why a different approach is needed. A spotlight on policing While sparse data makes accurate measurement difficult, most would agree violence and lawlessness are increasing in many parts of PNG. The broader context for this violence includes: rural decay lack of economic opportunities exploitative resource extraction a debilitating cost of living crisis, and frustrations with a political system that has failed to deliver services or development to a youthful and rapidly growing population. Yet despite the multiple factors contributing to PNG’s “law and order” problems, it is common to focus on just one: the shortcomings of the country’s law enforcement agencies. As a result, the solution is often simplistic: more robust policing. Typically, this involves the deployment of heavily armed mobile squads, often long after events on the ground have got out of control. This is usually followed by the abrupt withdrawal of these squads when the fighting ends. This year, again, national leaders were calling for reactive and militarised policing, including the use of lethal force .  In February, police were warning , “We will shoot to kill anyone brandishing a weapon.” There is a superficial appeal to the logic of violent policing responses. After all, rather than bows and arrows, today’s warriors are armed with high-powered firearms . As seen in conflicts around the world, the temptation to respond to violence with more violence is incredibly strong. Yet we also have decades of experience indicating such approaches in PNG simply do not bring about positive change . Worse, such responses often exacerbate trauma and undermine ongoing local peace-building efforts. A different approach Perhaps we should instead turn for inspiration to Bougainville . This autonomous region of PNG, wracked by conflict in the 1980s and 90s, has since become a poster-child for post-conflict peacebuilding. Bougainville’s peace process was driven by local actors – traditional leaders, women’s organisations, church groups and others – who creatively  adapted older forms of peacemaking and reconciliation to new circumstances. This approach is working in numerous micro-experiments around the country, including informal regulation in urban settlements . For example, Gerehu, a sprawling suburb of Port Moresby, was once characterised by carjackings, burglaries, drugs and violence. It has turned into a relative oasis in recent years. This is due to work by motivated individuals driving local transformation, linking together scattered state resources and civil society energy. It’s time for PNG as a whole to adopt such an approach, with policing seen as part of a shared governance agenda that involves civil society as active partners. A mediation takes place at the market in Enga, in PNG. Sinclair Dinnen/Author provided Changing the framing of violence An important first step is to change the way violence is framed in PNG. Portraying it as the preserve of unruly tribes, lawless individuals or criminal gangs disconnected from society and state is inaccurate and unhelpful. It suggests these groups are “out there” needing to be “civilised” by the state. However, some reports suggest PNG’s political and business elites may be implicated in resourcing such violence. They may perceive electoral advantage from violence and insecurity , or economic gain such as land-grabbing . State failures are also a major contributor to violence. The erosion of services such as health, education and justice have accentuated societal frustration across the board, not least among disenfranchised youth who are often blamed for violence and disorder. This frustration has been fuelled by the sheer lack of economic opportunities for the growing youth population. It has also been reported that protagonists of contemporary criminality in PNG  come from outside its borders , with growing issues of drug and arms trafficking. The problem of violence needs to be seen as one driven by both state and society. The responsibility for finding a peaceful way forward must also be shared. This requires genuine work with local leaders, including women leaders, to address existing and new security threats. There is hope investment in such long-term partnerships will be supported by at least some of PNG’s most senior leaders. Encouragingly, the PNG police commissioner, David Manning, said in January this year that “police needed to start empowering community-based leaders.” Another high priority is bringing courts and other justice services into areas where they often have a limited and fleeting presence. Local leaders often need state back-up to resolve small disputes before they escalate into warfare. If violent forms of self-help are to be avoided, people need to see perpetrators of violent crime face the consequences. This includes the entrepreneurs and beneficiaries of conflict, and not just the fighters on the ground. Bringing peace to PNG requires so much more than simply demanding it through the barrel of a gun. Miranda Forsyth receives funding from the Australian Research Council.

        "article_text": "This year Aotearoa New Zealand saw the highest rate of business closures since 2015, with 10,662 companies removed from the Company’s Office quarterly register . During the second quarter of 2024, company removals increased by 2,786 (a 35.6% increase) compared to the same period last year. But the closures have not been felt equally. Female entrepreneurs have been particularly hard hit. High-profile women-owned businesses such as Supy , Sunfed and Mina have all closed their doors. According to one global report , family commitments, as well as the pandemic, posed bigger hurdles for women entrepreneurs than their male counterparts. In the survey spanning 49 countries, 18% of female entrepreneurs who quit or exited a business did so for personal and family reasons, compared to just 12.6% of men. Our research examined the personal and family reasons behind women entrepreneurs’ decision to exit their businesses. While the respondents we interviewed were based in the United Kingdom, the responses reflected experiences seen in New Zealand and elsewhere. We found women entrepreneurs were often felt they had no option other than to exit or close their business if they wanted to preserve a viable home life. Household demands We interviewed 16 women founders in the UK who exited their startups for personal reasons largely unrelated to financial or performance issues. These reasons typically involved balancing household and business demands, and often included gendered responsibilities for child and eldercare. Frequently, men’s careers came first in partner households. For instance, one beauty therapist closed her growing business to look after her children because her husband’s medical career was so demanding. As she explained: If we had both tried to focus on careers, we would have clashed, and the children and family life would have suffered. Another woman who had established an Irish dance school franchise, running across seven cities, reluctantly chose to sell. She explained travel demands with two young children meant continuing her successful business was no longer feasible. Having one, I can travel around the world with him. I used to bring him in his little baby bucket to the dance studio and keep him with me some days. I hated doing that because I felt it was very unprofessional. But sometimes, you’ve just got to do it, right? But with two, it was like, okay, this is not feasible anymore. When I got pregnant with [my second child], I was starting to consider what was my next step. Even women who were childless often cited gendered personal reasons. One woman’s harrowing experience of IVF forced her to rethink whether entrepreneurship was the right career for her. Another had diverted time to support her sister, to whom she had been egg donor, through the loss of premature twins. Her absence from the business resulted in gradual income decline. She explained grief and emotional toil left her depleted and unable to drive new business: It was like somebody had taken my batteries out. I just did not work anymore. Delving into such emotions and how women made sense of their exit decisions was explored and put further flesh and blood into their “personal” reasons. Within the combined 16 interview transcripts, we documented 47 different negative emotions, versus 17 different positive emotions. This imbalance demonstrates the involuntary nature of business exits. But more concerningly, we draw attention to the potential damaging effects these emotions have on women’s wellbeing and confidence, as well as the broader reconstruction of their career and work identities. Having it all The women we spoke with rationalised their exit decisions by pointing to the expectations on them to prioritise family. They blamed themselves for failing to see through this supposed opportunity to “have it all”. Time and time again our societies pedal the myth that entrepreneurship is the panacea for work/life imbalance, and the secret to unlocking that much desired career goal of flexibility over one’s work. As Uma, an ex-entrepreneur, explained: I was told that [business ownership] would be flexible. I wanted something where I wouldn’t have to work full time, but I was completely wrong about that – especially with setting up your own business. It takes over your life and just becomes another baby. There needs to be a new conversation, recognising business and personal expectations on female founders are often incompatible. Business comes with costs Policies and media should stop presenting self-employment as a cost-free solution for women . At times, it is a poor career choice, particularly when talented women could potentially be adding economic and social value in organisations with family-inclusive practices and policies that can support them. Of course, women should still be encouraged and helped if they do want to build a business. Many, particularly those with high levels of human and entrepreneurial capital, do create successful and sustainable ventures. But the evidence indicates the universal “more (startups) is better” thesis is the wrong approach. Too often advocates argue governments should focus on creating “cheaper, faster, simpler” ways to set up in business. A more nuanced approach would benefit from firstly understanding the kinds of people who become entrepreneurs, and how peer networks and the financing environment can help. Entrepreneurship continues to be presented to women as a way to build work-life balance. But this must be balanced with a “reality check” regarding the poor prospects for those entering crowded, volatile sectors, operating part-time, or who are sole household earners without the benefit of an additional secure income.

        "article_text": "Homelessness, a crisis that affects about 11 per cent of Canadians in their lifetime , often begins with eviction. Once a person or family is evicted, they are set on a trajectory that can lead to chronic homelessness as they try to find affordable housing in an increasingly competitive market. For example, consider a long-term tenant in Kitchener paying $1,300 for a two-bedroom apartment. If evicted — whether due to a landlord’s decision to move in a family member, demolish the building or sell it — the tenant will be thrust into a housing market where the average rent for a similar unit is $2,327 . This steep price increase is untenable for many, especially those earning minimum wage. The risk of eviction is not just limited to those in precarious financial situations, but can impact renters across the board. This reality highlights the urgent need for stronger tenant protections to safeguard individuals and families from being unhoused. In the metropolitan area of Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo, for instance, there are no neighbourhoods with affordable one- or two-bedroom rentals for full-time minimum wage workers. All across Canada, the average cost of rent is increasing to untenable levels . This situation is even more dire for seniors relying on fixed incomes, single parents and those on social assistance. For example, a single person’s maximum monthly shelter allowance through Ontario Works is $390 and is $697 for a family of three. For international students without government support, the situation is particularly bleak . As an eviction prevention worker, my work and the work of my colleagues is crucial for stopping people from falling into circumstances that expose them to further marginalization and hardship. Systems of oppression The most marginalized groups in society are often the hardest hit by housing instability. Statistics show that low-income individuals, particularly those who are Indigenous and racialized people, as well as people with disabilities, people with mental health and addiction issues, and newcomers, are disproportionately represented among those facing homelessness . Systems of oppression impact the most marginalized first and most severely . Those who are poor, Black, Indigenous or people of colour, elderly or living with disabilities face the greatest barriers to meeting their basic needs, including securing stable housing. It’s clear that current strategies are falling short of addressing the issue. The housing stability system often overlooks critical realities , such as the near-impossibility of securing new rental housing after being evicted from an affordable unit for those not earning a high income. Social housing waitlists in many regions stretch to seven years or longer, and even below average market rent units may be out of reach or unsuitable for families with specific needs. This perpetuates the cycle of housing instability, leaving the most vulnerable populations with few options. Ending chronic homelessness Supporting low-income tenants through affordable housing must be a priority for addressing the growing housing crisis. To effectively combat short-sighted policies about who is eligible for financial support when rent payments fall behind, a more holistic approach is needed — one that considers the long-term consequences of eviction . Since the removal of rent control on vacant units in Ontario in 1996 , the availability of affordable housing has steadily declined. A more compassionate and human-centred approach is needed to provide support to those at risk of eviction. To end chronic homelessness , we must stop evictions. Adopting a community-based perspective is essential to protect vulnerable tenants from the risk of homelessness. The Region of Waterloo’s new Property Tax Exemption for Affordable Housing Program is a promising step in the right direction. By incentivizing landlords to maintain affordable units, this program could help preserve existing housing stock. However, a broader, multi-pronged approach that considers the well-being of entire communities is necessary to create lasting solutions. Growing wealth divide Renters in Canada generally have lower incomes and spend more money on housing than homeowners. In 2023, while Canadian homeowners saved seven per cent of their take-home pay, renters, on average, spent nine per cent more than they earned . The wealth disparity is stark, with homeowners’ net worth being four times that of renters. Multi-property owners have been the biggest buyers of Ontario properties since 2017. In 2021, 22 per cent of Ontario’s property purchases were made by those who already owned property. It has become close to impossible for renters to save enough for a down payment and, even if they can, they don’t have much of a chance to compete with investors. As Brian Doucet, Canadian Research Chair in Urban Change and Social Inclusion at the University of Waterloo, has noted, housing is a human right and a lucrative business , a contradiction that lies at the root of the problem. Simply increasing the housing supply won’t resolve the issue if new units are unaffordable and cater primarily to investors rather than those in need. The construction of high-rise condos with expensive rental units will only exacerbate the issue. The focus should be on building housing that actually meets affordable housing needs. Community-centred approach To truly address the housing crisis, it is essential to prevent the loss of affordable units and protect vulnerable tenants from eviction. Incentives for landlords to maintain affordable housing are crucial, as is halting any development that results in a net loss of such units. A long-term, community-centred approach is necessary — one that goes beyond quick fixes and addresses the root causes of housing instability. The working conditions of those on the front lines of this crisis, like myself, also need to be addressed. Workers are often overwhelmed and burned out, but there is hope. My experience in eviction prevention has shown that meaningful change is possible through the collaborative efforts of peer support workers, outreach workers, lawyers, social workers, settlement workers and mental health specialists. However, real progress requires a candid assessment of the current system’s failures. By acknowledging these shortcomings, Canada can begin to create meaningful transformational change that genuinely improves the lives of the people who live here.

        "article_text": "The Columbia River Treaty is a landmark water-management agreement, ratified in 1964, by the United States and Canada which aimed to co-ordinate water management within the Columbia River Basin, particularly through the construction of four large dams in the headwaters. Three treaty dams were built in B.C. with an additional dam located in Montana. Last month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden announced an “Agreement in Principle” for the modernization of the Columbia River Treaty . A map of the Columbia River basin. (Kmusser - based on USGS and Digital Chart of the World data.) , CC BY The agreement is the culmination of six years of negotiation and countless environmental studies of the rivers and reservoirs of the region. The negotiations were precedent-setting, with the engagement of two countries, a province and multiple states alongside extensive Indigenous representation. The proposed modernization has a real chance to better recognize the ecological needs of the region alongside a range of social, cultural and economic impacts in a changing climate . A treaty for a different time The original treaty objectives were narrowly focused on flood risk management and hydropower generation, issues that remain prevalent in the basin to this day with the Columbia River system providing approximately 40 per cent of U.S. hydropower . Demand on hydropower systems is rising in both the U.S. and Canada as both countries move to decarbonize their power grids . An additional, decidedly more modern, complication is that with inexpensive hydropower the lower Columbia River region has become a hub for data centres, with companies including Google and Microsoft maintaining facilities in the region. A report on the agreement in principle produced by CBC News. The waters flowing from the Canadian treaty dams pass through additional dams downstream, including 11 hydropower dams on the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon. These are largely run-of-the-river facilities that do not store water, and to recognize the considerable increase in power production enabled by the seasonal storage from the Canadian reservoirs, the Treaty specified the “Canadian Entitlement,” which awarded one-half of the additional American hydropower capacity to Canada. To help meet the growing electrical demand, each of the four treaty dams created a massive water storage reservoir. Hydroelectric reservoirs are effectively giant batteries that store potential energy over time and allow for the controlled release of water to enable near-year-round power generation. However, this reliability comes at a cost. The four reservoirs work by annually flooding approximately 600 km of river valleys. The flooding is seasonal, and the yearly cycles of inundation and exposure are lethal to all vegetation and terrestrial life, resulting in ecological wastelands during draw down . The valleys have been home to Indigenous nations for millennia but were sparsely inhabited by the 1960s and the voices of Indigenous peoples were severely underrepresented in the designing of the original treaty . Addressing the ecological and social impacts while maintaining the economic outcomes is the key aim of the recent modernization efforts. Modernizing efforts A core focus of the treaty modernization process has been to broaden the operational objectives to include ecosystem function as a third priority alongside flood control and hydropower with a further focus on socio-economic benefits and Indigenous cultural values . To enable greater flexibility in the operations of the three Canadian treaty dams, about one-third of the combined water storage would be available for Canada to use as it sees fit. Consequently, the Canadian Entitlement is to be scaled back as Canada is obliged to release less water to American hydropower dams downstream. Some of this water available to Canada could help restore river ecosystems — including the biologically rich floodplain woodlands . As a model, the American Libby Dam has shown success in the use of “environmental flows” to help restore downstream environments . The four treaty dams are the Duncan Dam, Mica Dam and Keenleyside Dam in B.C. and the Libby Dam in Montana, pictured here with the artificial Lake Koocanusa reservoir in the background.

The enhancement strategies will also incorporate Indigenous guidance that encourages a more holistic perspective, and a change in thinking from “trade-offs” to “balance.” Salmon reintroductions are a priority for Indigenous nations and the treaty modernization would promote transboundary co-operation for salmon restoration. This co-ordination of Indigenous knowledge and western science could help in both ecosystem restoration and reconciliation . However, for the basin-wide objectives, the Canadian treaty dams are only three of the 55 major dams in the Columbia Basin, along with 10-fold more smaller dams. For salmon recovery and other outcomes, other dams must also contribute toward these restoration efforts.

Favourably, the U.S. recently committed US$1 billion for salmon recovery . The Agreement in Principle provides a promising framework and work is still ongoing to modernize the Columbia River Treaty. This will allow for innovative water management with the hope of reasserting the ecological, socio-economic and Indigenous cultural values that were neglected with the original Treaty: we have a second chance.

        "article_text": "The UK government has recently announced a review into their counter-terrorism strategy, focussing on responses to “extremist ideologies”. This announcement named misogyny as one of its extremist ideological trends of interest. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: For too long, governments have failed to address the rise in extremism, both online and on our streets, and we’ve seen the number of young people radicalised online grow. Calls for action on the effects of extremist ideologies propagated by online masculinity influencers have recently increased. Last month, The UK National Police Chiefs’ Council described the radicalisation of boys into misogyny as a “national emergency”. They noted that online extremist influencers such as Andrew Tate recruit and radicalise boys in ways similar to how followers are drawn into other extremist ideologies. This has profoundly dangerous implications for women and girls. Reframing how violent crimes are conceptualised has an impact on how seriously they are taken by police and how they are resourced. At a time when misogynistic attitudes are on the rise , and the crisis of violence against women continues, understanding misogyny as an extremist ideology is key to shaping appropriate responses. Read more: We research online 'misogynist radicalisation'. Here's what parents of boys should know What’s happening in Australia? There have been concerted efforts to improve markers of gender equity in Australia. But backlash to the project of gender equity and efforts to eradicate gender-based violence continues. Our recent research has found misogynist ideology is increasingly present among boys and young men in Australian schools. This problem is amplified by extremist content infiltrating boys’ and young men’s social media feeds. Our interviews with women teaching in schools has uncovered the presence of misogynist beliefs among boys in schools across the country. These include beliefs about women’s inherent inferiority, commitments to regressive gender roles, and a brazen entitlement to treat women and girls in sexist and derogatory ways. We have argued that a process of misogynistic radicalisation seems to have occurred. By this we mean that sustained exposure to misogynistic content, delivered by social media, has reshaped how boys and young men understand women’s roles and their relationships with them. Online communities, certain social circles, and media content can act as echo chambers that reinforce and deepen misogynistic beliefs. This in turn can lead to progressive exposure to increasingly extreme views on gender roles. There are similarities here with radicalisation into far-right extremism. This typically involves individuals being exposed to more mainstream or even seemingly benign nationalist or anti-immigrant sentiment, and then more extremist ideologies. Misogyny and gender-based violence The rise of misogynist attitudes among Australian boys occurs alongside an existing crisis — endemic levels of gender-based violence and murder perpetrated against women. Researchers have long argued that gendered violence and violence informed by extremist ideology, such as terrorism or mass casualty attacks, are inextricably connected. Increased exposure to misogynist content is a concern not only for its potential to harm, but also for its connection to other forms of extremism. Recent research on violent extremism in Australia found that individuals who hold misogynist attitudes are more likely to support other types of violent extremism. This report also noted that gendered biases are overlooked as pathways to radicalisation and violent extremism. Conversation about how to categorise misogynistic violence increased following the Bondi stabbings earlier this year. There was some resistance to naming the attack as an act of terrorism, with definitional limitations preventing it from being categorised in that way. This is despite police stating it was “obvious”  the attacker targeted women. Failing to recognise these acts of violence as informed by misogyny as an extremist ideology prevents us from fully understanding its radicalising influence and how it propels violence against women. What difference would labelling misogyny as extremism make? Despite their different focuses, misogynistic extremism has much in common with other forms of extremism such as far-right nationalism. They are each characterised by rigid ideologies, violence, and systemic oppression. They also challenge principles of equality and justice. The rigid belief in the superiority of men over women that is the cornerstone of misogyny is akin to the far right beliefs in the racial superiority of white people over other racial and ethnic groups. At their core is the systemic oppression of the group to which they position themselves as superior. Misogynist ideology, including the belief in men’s innate role in the protection of women and in the rightness of women’s subordination, are a feature of many other extremist and far-right ideologies, including neo-Nazism . Research has established this connection between gender ideology, extremism and terrorism, and also how these ideas spread across online platforms and channels. Recognising misogyny as a form of extremism enables governments to approach it with the seriousness it deserves. It supports the development of targeted policies and legal frameworks to combat gender-based violence, systemic discrimination, and societal division. Recognising the gendered components of extremist ideology is essential to accurately responding to their risk and understanding their transmission. For example, in Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner Micaela Cronin’s inaugural yearly report card delivered to the Press Club in August, she noted that if the same intelligence resources were devoted to domestic violence as to terrorism, some women might be saved. Not all people who hold extremist beliefs will end up committing acts of violence, and extremism exists on a continuum of beliefs and ideas. However, the focus of the definition should not be on the outcome of the belief or the consequence.  It’s important to identify that misogynistic beliefs are extremist , and should not be accepted and tolerated. Australian governments need to act It has been widely recommended that federal and state governments should make extremist ideologies a national security priority. This should include ideologies that perpetuate violence against women. As recent research recommendations attest , prevention should attend to the gendered elements of the radicalisation process. Education is a crucial part of primary prevention work. Part of that work will be accurately categorising and naming misogyny for what it is . While there is some attention in curriculums to preventing violent extremism, this rarely goes beyond a broad consideration of social cohesion. If we are committed to the eradication of gender-based violence in Australia, we must accurately categorise misogyny as its underlying extremist ideology.

It’s intended to be used in combination with a reduced-energy diet and increased physical activity. So how does Wegovy work and how much weight can you expect to lose while taking it? And what are the potential risks – and costs – for those who use it? Let’s look at what the science says. What is Wegovy? Wegovy is a brand name for the medication semaglutide. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). This means it makes your body’s own glucagon-like peptide-1 hormone, called GLP-1 for short, work better. Normally when you eat, the body releases the GLP-1 hormone which helps signal to your brain that you are full. Semaglutides enhance this effect, leading to a feeling of fullness, even when you haven’t eaten. Another role of GLP-1 is to stimulate the body to produce more insulin, a hormone which helps lower the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. That’s why semaglutides have been used for several years to treat type 2 diabetes. Wegovy is self-injected once a week. S Becker/Shutterstock How does Wegovy differ from Ozempic? Like Wegovy, Ozempic is a semaglutide. The way Wegovy and Ozempic work in the body are essentially the same. They’re made by the same pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk. But there are two differences: 1) They are approved for two different (but related) reasons. In Australia (and the United States), Ozempic is approved for use to improve blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. By managing blood glucose levels effectively, the medication aims to reduce the risk of major complications, such as heart disease. Wegovy is approved for use alongside diet and exercise for people with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater, or 27 or greater but with other conditions such as high blood pressure. Wegovy can also be used in people aged 12 years and older. Like Ozempic, Wegovy aims to reduce the risk of future health complications, including heart disease. 2) They are both injected but come in different strengths. Ozempic is available in pre-loaded single-dose pens with varying dosages of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg per injection. The dose can be slowly increased, up to a maximum of 2 mg per week, if needed. Wegovy is available in prefilled single-dose pens with doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.7 mg, or 2.4 mg. The treatment starts with a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly for four weeks, after which the dose is gradually increased until reaching a maintenance dose of 2.4 mg weekly. While it’s unknown what the impact of Wegovy’s introduction will be on Ozempic’s availability, Ozempic is still anticipated to be in low supply for the remainder of 2024. Is Wegovy effective for weight loss? Given Wegovy is a semaglutide, there is very strong evidence it can help people lose weight and maintain this weight loss. A recent study found that over four years, participants taking Wevovy as indicated experienced an average weight loss of 10.2% body weight and a reduction in waist circumference of 7.7cm. For those who stop taking the medication, analyses have shown that about two-thirds of weight lost is regained . Wegovy can help people lose weight and maintain their weight loss – while they take the drug. Mladen Mitrinovic/Shutterstock What are the side effects of Wegovy? The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting. However, other serious side effects are also possible because of the whole-of-body impact of the medication. Thyroid tumours and cancer have been detected as a risk in animal studies, yet are rarely seen in human scientific literature . In the four-year Wegovy trial , 16.6% of participants who received Wegovy (1,461 people) experienced an adverse event that led to them permanently discontinuing their use of the medication. This was higher than the 8.2% of participants (718 people) who received the placebo (with no active ingredient). Side effects included gastrointestinal disorders (including nausea and vomiting), which affected 10% of people who used Wegovy compared to 2% of people who used the placebo. Gallbladder-related disorders occurred in 2.8% of people who used Wegovy, and 2.3% of people who received the placebo. Recently, concerns about suicidal thoughts and behaviours have been raised, after a global analysis reviewed more than 36 million reports of adverse events from semaglutide (Ozempic or Wegovy) since 2000. There were 107 reports of suicidal thoughts and self-harm among people taking semaglutide, sadly including six actual deaths. When people stopped the medication, 62.5% found the thoughts went away. What we don’t know is whether dose, weight loss, or previous mental health status or use of antidepressants had a role to play. Finally, concerns are growing about the negative effect of semaglutides on our social and emotional connection with food. Anecdotal and scientific evidence suggests people who use semaglutides significantly reduce their daily dietary intake (as anticipated) by skipping meals and avoiding social occasions – not very enjoyable for people and their loved ones. How can people access Wegovy? Wegovy is available for purchase at pharmacists with a prescription from a doctor. But there is a hefty price tag. Wegovy is not currently subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, leaving patients to cover the cost. The current cost is estimated at around A$460 per month dose. If you’re considering Wegovy, make an appointment with your doctor for individual advice.

        "article_text": "Jon Bilous/Shutterstock Imagine a group of young men gathered at a picturesque college campus in New England, in the United States, during the northern summer of 1956. It’s a small casual gathering. But the men are not here for campfires and nature hikes in the surrounding mountains and woods. Instead, these pioneers are about to embark on an experimental journey that will spark countless debates for decades to come and change not just the course of technology – but the course of humanity. Welcome to the Dartmouth Conference – the birthplace of artificial intelligence (AI) as we know it today. What transpired here would ultimately lead to ChatGPT and the many other kinds of AI which now help us diagnose disease, detect fraud, put together playlists and write articles (well, not this one). But it would also create some of the many problems the field is still trying to overcome. Perhaps by looking back, we can find a better way forward. The summer that changed everything In the mid 1950s, rock’n’roll was taking the world by storm. Elvis’s Heartbreak Hotel was topping the charts, and teenagers started embracing James Dean’s rebellious legacy. But in 1956, in a quiet corner of New Hampshire, a different kind of revolution was happening. The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence , often remembered as the Dartmouth Conference, kicked off on June 18 and lasted for about eight weeks. It was the the brainchild of four American computer scientists – John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon – and brought together some of the brightest minds in computer science, mathematics and cognitive psychology at the time. These scientists, along with some of the 47 people they invited, set out to tackle an ambitious goal: to make intelligent machines. As McCarthy put it in the conference proposal , they aimed to find out “how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans”. Trenchard More, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Oliver Selfridge and Ray Solomonoff were among those who attended the Dartmouth Conference on artificial intelligence in 1956. Joe Mehling , CC BY The birth of a field – and a problematic name The Dartmouth Conference didn’t just coin the term “artificial intelligence”; it coalesced an entire field of study. It’s like a mythical Big Bang of AI – everything we know about machine learning, neural networks and deep learning now traces its origins back to that summer in New Hampshire. But the legacy of that summer is complicated. Artificial intelligence won out as a name over others proposed or in use at the time. Shannon preferred the term “automata studies”, while two other conference participants (and the soon-to-be creators of the first AI program), Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, continued to use “complex information processing” for a few years still. But here’s the thing: having settled on AI, no matter how much we try, today we can’t seem to get away from comparing AI to human intelligence. This comparison is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it drives us to create AI systems that can match or exceed human performance in specific tasks. We celebrate when AI outperforms humans in games such as chess or Go, or when it can detect cancer in medical images with greater accuracy than human doctors. On the other hand, this constant comparison leads to misconceptions. When a computer beats a human at Go , it is easy to jump to the conclusion that machines are now smarter than us in all aspects – or that we are at least well on our way to creating such intelligence. But AlphaGo is no closer to writing poetry than a calculator. And when a large language model sounds human, we start wondering if it is sentient . But ChatGPT is no more alive than a talking ventriloquist’s dummy. The overconfidence trap The scientists at the Dartmouth Conference were incredibly optimistic about the future of AI. They were convinced they could solve the problem of machine intelligence in a single summer. 2006 marked the 50th anniversary of the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on artificial intelligence. Joe Mehling , CC BY This overconfidence has been a recurring theme in AI development, and it has led to several cycles of hype and disappointment. Simon stated in 1965 that “machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do”. Minsky predicted in 1967 that “within a generation […] the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ will substantially be solved”. Popular futurist Ray Kurzweil now predicts it’s only five years away: “we’re not quite there, but we will be there, and by 2029 it will match any person”. Reframing our thinking: new lessons from Dartmouth So, how can AI researchers, AI users, governments, employers and the broader public move forward in a more balanced way? A key step is embracing the difference and utility of machine systems. Instead of focusing on the race to “artificial general intelligence”, we can focus on the unique strengths of the systems we have built – for example, the enormous creative capacity of image models. Shifting the conversation from automation to augmentation is also important. Rather than pitting humans against machines, let’s focus on how AI can assist and augment human capabilities . Let’s also emphasise ethical considerations. The Dartmouth participants didn’t spend much time discussing the ethical implications of AI. Today, we know better, and must do better. We must also refocus research directions. Let’s emphasise research into AI interpretability and robustness, interdisciplinary AI research and explore new paradigms of intelligence that aren’t modelled on human cognition. Finally, we must manage our expectations about AI. Sure, we can be excited about its potential. But we must also have realistic expectations, so that we can avoid the disappointment cycles of the past. As we look back at that summer camp 68 years ago, we can celebrate the vision and ambition of the Dartmouth Conference participants. Their work laid the foundation for the AI revolution we’re experiencing today. By reframing our approach to AI – emphasising utility, augmentation, ethics and realistic expectations – we can honour the legacy of Dartmouth while charting a more balanced and beneficial course for the future of AI. After all, the real intelligence lies not just in creating smart machines, but in how wisely we choose to use and develop them.

On the one hand, it drives us to create AI systems that can match or exceed human performance in specific tasks.",

        "article_text": "Shutterstock Wine is the most popular alcoholic drink in Australia. We have more than 2,100 local wineries , as well as copious amounts of imported wines. With so much to choose from – and prices ranging from less than $5 to more than $1,000 – even wine aficionados can sometimes struggle to pick a bottle. Is a $1,000 bottle of wine 200 times “better” than a $5 bottle? Ultimately, our enjoyment of wine is based on our personal taste (literally). But unless you have the opportunity to taste before you buy, you have to look for other quality cues. A consumer making a wine purchase may consider a number of factors such as brand reputation, reviews/ratings (including recommendations from friends), taste (such as grape variety, flavour and sweetness preference), occasion, price, and the appeal of the label, packaging or name. Alongside this, wineries and liquor retailers also proactively market their wines by displaying high scores from wine reviews and wine show results. But how valuable are these reviews and results, really? The (many) ways of reviewing wine First, what qualifies someone to be a wine reviewer? Although there are no specific qualifications, reviewers will typically have extensive training and experience in wine appreciation and/or winemaking. Importantly, wine is generally rated based on its quality relative to other wines of the same grape variety and growing region. This means it is problematic to directly compare ratings across different wine varieties and regions. Robert Parker, one of the world’s top wine critics, developed a 100-point rating system for wine. While variants exist, the 100-point scale typically starts at 50, with points awarded for colour (5 points max), aroma/bouquet (15 points), flavour/finish (20 points) and overall quality (10 points). In Australia, James Halliday is a legend of the wine industry and founder of the Halliday Wine Companion, which provides tasting notes, ratings based on Halliday’s own version of the 100-point system , winery ratings and annual awards . Similarly, the internationally acclaimed Huon Hooke and Bob Campbell (one of few to hold the prestigious Master of Wine qualification) provide The Real Review , which offers wine reviews, ratings, an annual “ top wineries ” ranking and a “ wine classification ” system for Australian and New Zealand wines. Wineries can submit wines to Wine Companion and The Real Review to be reviewed for free. However, the wineries don’t automatically own these reviews, and any subsequent usage by wineries of those reviews for marketing requires a Wine Companion or The Real Review winery membership. Another Australian-based wine reviewing organisation is Wine Pilot, founded by Angus Hughson. Wine Pilot charges $70 (plus GST) for an individual review, after which the winery can use the review for marketing for free. Similarly, Sam Kim’s New Zealand-based Wine Orbit charges $30 per bottle to review Australian wine, after which the review can be used for marketing. There are differing views as to whether an upfront fee for a wine review is appropriate – as well as how this compares to offering free reviews and then subsequently charging wineries annual memberships for their use. So, are wine reviews ‘independent’? This is a question readers will need to judge for themselves. Stories abound regarding the independence of reviewers and whether they have a vested financial interest in giving high reviews. If a reviewer gives a winery poor reviews, that winery may no longer come to them (and no longer pay them). At the same time the reviewer has their own integrity to consider. The Conversation reached out to Sam Kim, who said his $30 flat fee helped in running his small business – and that doing the work for free simply wasn’t viable. As to whether this affected his impartiality, he said: “I would like to say ‘no’, but it’s not up to me to judge. Consumers will ultimately decide that. And given I have been around a while, perhaps I’m doing okay much of the time.” Wine Pilot’s Angus Hughson said there was “potential for a number of factors to influence reviews by wine communicators”, including close personal relationships developed with wine makers as a result of their work. He said wine reviewing ultimately comes down to personal integrity, and that writers who inflated scores to be more widely quoted and/or recognised risked damaging their brand, thereby “eroding their influence in the long term.” Awards and reviews are one money-making aspect of the wine business. Shutterstock Halliday Managing Director Jacinta Hardie-Grant said Wine Companion’s subscription model for marketing did not influence the impartiality of reviews and that the various tasters do not know whether the winery behind a tasting submission has a subscription or not. The Real Review did not respond before deadline. Not an exact science Let’s now consider wine shows and awards. There are some prestigious wine shows such as the London-based Decanter Awards , as well as various smaller shows. Show operators typically charge wineries to enter their wines, so you really do “have to be in it to win it”. Some wineries choose not to enter, while others are renowned for repeat entries. But there is a potential problem with the wine show process. Ideally, a rigid, scientific method would be used to determine the winners – but this is not always possible, or indeed practical. Wine is judged “blind”, whereby judges are unaware of the brand. This is a positive. However, the judges will typically judge numerous wines, so the order of judging can affect the results, which is a negative. Wine show results and awards also often compare across wine varieties and regions, or have a “Winery of the Year” award. These results and awards have their own sets of judging criteria and are often viewed with a level of scepticism . Consumers should remember these results and awards, while they do have some science behind them , are subjective. Trust your taste buds Wine reviewers regularly release results of their wine review activities. My inbox subsequently gets bombarded by wineries promoting their winning wines, referring to reviews and award results. But these reviews and results remain subjective. Just because one person likes a wine, that doesn’t mean someone else (you) will definitely like it! Try before you buy is the ideal. On this front, your best options are to attend tastings offered at wine shops, visit winery cellar-doors, or buy wines by the glass at restaurants. The next time you buy a bottle, you may still wish to refer to the reviews or award labels – but don’t break your bank over them.

        "article_text": "Our cultural touchstones series looks at influential books. Despite publishing James Baldwin’s first novel, Go Tell it on the Mountain , publishing house Alfred A. Knopf rejected his second. Upon receiving the manuscript of Giovanni’s Room in 1955, editor Henry Carlisle pronounced it a failure, telling Baldwin the novel, if published, would damage the author’s reputation . While Carlisle insisted the rejection had nothing to do with the book’s content, Baldwin was convinced otherwise. Knopf, he thought, did not want a story of homosexual love between a white American expat living in Paris and an Italian bartender being told by a Black man from Harlem. When Giovanni’s Room was finally published by the Dial Press in 1956, reception was mixed. The novel was critiqued both for its queerness, and for not, as was expected from Baldwin, focusing explicitly on the struggle of Black America. Critic Hilton Als has characterised the insipid response as follows: The dirt and sex you wrote about in ‘Go Tell It on the Mountain,’ and some of the essays. Can you forgo your imagination and be black for me? Here, instead, was a story about David, the narrator, who, observing his reflection in a windowpane, tells the reader: My face is like a face you have seen many times. My ancestors conquered a continent, pushing across death-laden plains, until they came to an ocean which faced away from Europe into a darker past. Goodreads Baldwin, in this novel, is interested in the privilege David’s whiteness brings, and the consequent belief that his own needs and desires naturally supersede the needs and desires of those around him. The novel is also interested in what it means to be queer when homosexuality is so cruelly punished by society that the punishment becomes internalised, self-inflicted. What does it mean, Baldwin wonders, to be unacceptable to oneself? Nearly 70 years after its publication, Giovanni’s Room is rightly considered one of the great novels of the 20th century. It is a novel about the ways in which love can be difficult to bear, and properly knowing oneself can be difficult to bear. It is about the incapacity to confront one’s own desires and the terrible things that fear will make us do if we shrink from ourselves and others in order to escape it. Language honed in the pulpit In the opening pages, we learn David’s fiancé, Hella, is returning to America, the titular Giovanni has been sentenced to death – for what crime we are not told – and is awaiting the guillotine, and that we are meeting David on the worst morning of his life. Much of what follows occurs in flashback, as David attempts to make sense of his relationship with Giovanni, their love and their pain, and where things went wrong. Colm Tóibín, writing about Giovanni’s Room in The New Yorker , has described Baldwin as “the greatest American prose stylist of his generation”. The novel is indeed an object of astonishing beauty. Baldwin’s prose has the rare quality of feeling spoken onto the page while remaining dazzlingly expressive, a language at once natural and elegant. In his first essay collection, Notes of a Native Son , Baldwin speculated that his style was generated by a mixture of the King James Bible, the rhetoric of the store-front church, something ironic and violent and perpetually understated in Negro speech – and something of Dickens’ love for bravura wit. As a teenager, Baldwin, like his father, became a successful preacher. In his magisterial autobiographical essay, “Letter from a Region of my Mind”, Baldwin writes that this newfound vocation, at which he found himself extraordinarily adept, meant that there were hours and even whole days when I could not be interrupted – not even by my father. I had immobilized him. It took rather more time for me to realize that I had also immobilized myself, and had escaped from nothing whatever. This capacity with language Baldwin developed in the pulpit – the power to persuade, to enliven, to uplift, to condemn – invests Giovanni’s Room with a resonant metaphysical force, reminding us of the moral and aesthetic splendour that remains available despite our human frailties. This is entwined with the profound and disabling anxiety accompanying the revelation that you have become exquisitely articulate simply to avoid confronting a difficult truth. David admits this while reflecting on the story he is about to tell: I think now that if I had had any intimation that the self I was going to find would turn out to be only the same self from which I had spent so much time in flight, I would have stayed at home. David’s narration is an exercise in self-deception as much as self-discovery. He first encounters Giovanni at a gay bar in Paris, and they move quickly from sleeping together to living together in Giovanni’s dilapidated, cramped apartment. Giovanni is louchely charming, beautiful and, having invited David to drink white wine and eat oysters in the Parisian morning sun, stands in for the wonders of Europe, its allure and strangeness. He offers David an escape, the potential to be unburdened by the weight of American destiny, but also evokes in him terror, bringing to David’s attention his many irreconcilable contradictions, as an American at once repelled and enthralled by his home country, and as a gay man petrified by his attraction to men. In this tumultuous attachment, David sees only himself, the magnitude of his own feelings reducing Giovanni to an instrument of pleasure and self-loathing, obscuring his lover’s personhood. Paradoxes Baldwin, born in Harlem, 100 years ago this month, spent much of his early career in France, moving from New York to Paris in 1948, at only 24. He did so, in part, to escape the oppressive miasma of American racism, and to give himself the freedom to write. Despite arriving in France with only forty dollars, he found the space and atmosphere he needed to pen the books that launched his reputation – Go Tell it on the Mountain and Notes of a Native Son – and much of Giovanni’s Room. In Giovanni’s Room, the United States figures as an unignorable looming entity, a monster that can be fled but never outrun. As Baldwin wished to get out from under America, David fears returning to America. To survive abroad, David relies on money sent by his father, but the father’s increasingly desperate requests that his son come home make David think “of sediment at the bottom of a stagnant pond.” Yet, while carousing with Giovanni, made dizzy by the grandeur of Paris, he is struck by an overwhelming nostalgia and desire to return home across the ocean, to things and people I knew and understood; to those things, those places, those people which I would always, helplessly, and in whatever bitterness of spirit, love above all else. This simultaneous attraction to and repulsion from America was a tension Baldwin returned to throughout his life, with France playing the role of an alternative that was, inevitably, both wondrous and disappointing. In an essay on the archetype of the American student in Paris, Baldwin wrote that “from the vantage point of Europe, he discovers his own country”. An American in Paris may have escaped America, but they will not have escaped their Americanness. In 1957, Baldwin moved back to the US (later dividing his time between France and America). In a 1962 interview , Baldwin said despite the many troubles France was facing, the people possessed “a certain largeness and a certain freedom that is very hard to come by here [in America]”. Elsewhere, Baldwin remarks that the legend of Paris as a city of romance and freedom “is limited, as legends are limited, by being – literally – unliveable, and by referring to the past”. This paradox – the Paris of fantasy and the Paris of reality being at once irreconcilable and inextricable – is central to the novel, providing a setting, as it does, for a story of paradoxes. David is a coward with a magnificent ability to articulate his own cowardice, but an immobilising inability to undo the harm he causes. He recounts the significant suffering he has inflicted, yet is never quite able to escape the notion that this is his tragedy, rather than a tragedy for those that loved him. It is David’s deferral and indecision, a result of his incapacity to acknowledge the needs of either Hella or Giovanni, that ultimately causes his ruin. Giovanni’s Room is an intimate novel, both in the depth of feeling it has for its characters, and in its deeply felt knowledge of how so often, when we are called to bear witness to ourselves and to our capacity to hurt those we love, we turn away.

        "article_text": "Athletes from around the world are in Paris for the 2024 Paralympic Games. The Games will feature more than 4,000 athletes with various disabilities competing in 549 medal events. To ensure all athletes have a fair and equitable chance at achieving success at the Paralympics, organizers use a classification system that seeks to minimize the impact a person’s disability has on their performance. Ideally, classification means that, rather than having to change the rules of the event for each competitor, the Games themselves account for the unique ways people with disabilities run, jump, throw and otherwise compete. In athletics, for example, athletes compete across standard distances (100 metres, 200 metres, etc.), but only against those whose impairments affect them in similar ways. In team sports, like wheelchair rugby or basketball, athletes with different types and levels of impairment compete alongside and against one another. To ensure team competitions remain fair, athletes’ individual impairment levels are considered when deciding who will be on the field of play at any given time. Teams can therefore be comprised of athletes with more and less severe impairments, so long as each team as a whole is similarly able. However, while the concept of classification is relatively straightforward, the process of getting classified can be anything but. And for some athletes, it can itself be damaging. The classification process To become classified, athletes must compile medical documentation of their impairment before registering with their international federation and submitting themselves for observation immediately prior to an international competition. These observations typically include three elements: a medical and technical assessment and in-competition observations. Securing medical documentation can be costly and time consuming, and some athletes will be classified multiple times over their careers; this can be an arduous process . In addition to the time required to become classified, athletes often report feeling that, while Paralympic sport is meant to inspire change and improvements in the lives of people with disabilities , the process of classification can itself be ableist. Classification requires athletes share the most intimate details of their disability with a panel of strangers . This can often leave athletes feeling awkward and embarrassed by the process. Athletes’ experiences While classifiers have extensive training and professional experience related to human movement and disability, this expertise adds to athletes’ feelings of vulnerability. Because classifiers are in the position to grant or deny an athlete’s request, they hold significant power over the athletes they classify . When left unchecked, this can have devastating consequences for athletes. As a graduate student, I interviewed Paralympic athletes about their experiences with classification. One athlete shared that classifiers ignored their complaints of pain during an assessment and pushed them past their physical limit. That led to an injury and the athlete leaving their sport permanently shortly thereafter . This is not the first report of an athlete leaving sport due to issues with the classification process. Athletes and classifiers alike attribute such negative experiences to poor communication. Yet, because classification happens immediately prior to competition, there are few opportunities for athletes to speak informally with classifiers or ask questions about the process in a less pressurized environment. Even coaches report seldom having the chance to learn about classification . Improving the process Through my doctoral research , I sought to address this gap by recommending ways Canadian national sport organizations can better educate parasport participants about classification. The recommendations include developing improved staff training materials and dedicating additional financial and human resources to classification. Further work is needed, however, to ensure no more athletes leave sport as a result of classification. The International Paralympic Committee and international sport federations must consider more than just the efficacy of classification procedures when reviewing the Classification Code . Athletes’ experiences should be central to the design and implementation of classification procedures. To achieve this, sport federations must actively recruit former athletes to become classifiers. In addition, providing athletes with additional opportunity’s to meet with classifiers outside of competition will similarly improve communication between athletes and classifiers. So, when watching the Paralympics over the coming weeks, consider not just the amazing performances you see on TV, but the effort athletes have put into securing their spot in sport.

        "article_text": "Cooling streaks indicate the potential for two Niña's at once – Pacific and Atlantic, a rare event. NOAA Coral Reef Watch The North Atlantic Ocean has been running a fever for months, with surface temperatures at or near record highs . But cooling along the equator in both the Atlantic and eastern Pacific may finally be starting to bring some relief , particularly for vulnerable coral reef ecosystems. This cooling comes from two climate phenomena with similar names: La Niña, which forms in the tropical Pacific, and the less well-known Atlantic Niña. Both can affect the Atlantic hurricane season. While La Niña tends to bring conditions ideal for Atlantic hurricanes , the less powerful Atlantic Niña has the potential to reduce some of the hurricane risk. Cooling in the tropical Atlantic along the equator is a sign an Atlantic Niña may be forming. NOAA Climate.gov We’re ocean and atmospheric scientists who study this type of climate phenomenon. It’s rare to see both Niñas at the same time, yet in August 2024, both appeared to be developing . Let’s take a closer look at what that means. La Niña and its cousin, Atlantic Niña La Niña is part of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation , a well-known climate phenomenon that has widespread effects on climate and weather around the world. During La Niña, sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific dip below normal. Easterly trade winds then strengthen, allowing more cool water to well up along the equator off South America. That cooling affects the atmosphere in ways that reverberate across the planet. Some areas become stormier and others drier during La Niña, and the wind shear that can tear apart Atlantic hurricanes tends to weaken. La Niña and its warmer opposite, El Niño , oscillate every three to four years or so . La Niña and its opposite, El Niño, explained. NOAA. A similar climate phenomenon, Atlantic Niña , occurs in the Atlantic Ocean but at a much smaller scale and amplitude. It typically peaks around July or August and tends to have a shorter duration than its Pacific cousin, and much more modest and local impacts. Atlantic Niñas generally have the opposite effect of Atlantic Niños, which tend to reduce rainfall over Africa’s Sahel region and increase rainfall in Brazil and the countries that surround the Gulf of Guinea, such as Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon. While much weaker than their Pacific counterpart, Atlantic Niñas can, however, partially counteract La Niñas by weakening summer winds that help drive the upwelling that cools the eastern Pacific. Why are both happening now? In July and August 2024, meteorologists noted cooling that appeared to be the development of an Atlantic Niña along the equator. The winds at the ocean surface had been weak through most of the summer, and sea surface temperatures there were quite warm until early June , so signs of an Atlantic Niña emerging were a surprise. At the same time, waters along the equator in the eastern Pacific were also cooling, with La Niña conditions expected there by October or November. A map of sea surface temperature anomalies shows cooling along the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific regions, but much warmer than average temperatures in the Caribbean. NOAA Coral Reef Watch Getting a Pacific-Atlantic Niña combination is rare but not impossible . It’s like finding two different pendulums that are weakly coupled to swing in opposite directions moving together in time. The combinations of La Niña and Atlantic Niño, or El Niño and Atlantic Niña are more common. Good news or bad for hurricane season? An Atlantic Niña may initially suggest good news for those living in hurricane-prone areas. Cooler than average waters off the coast of Africa can suppress the formation of African easterly waves. These are clusters of thunderstorm activity that can form into tropical disturbances and eventually tropical storms or hurricanes. Tropical storms draw energy from the process of evaporating water associated with warm sea surface temperatures. So, cooling in the tropical Atlantic could weaken this process. That would leave less energy for the thunderstorms, which would reduce the probability of a tropical cyclone forming. However, NOAA takes all factors into account when it updates its Atlantic hurricane season outlook , released in early August, and it still anticipates an extremely active 2024 season. Tropical storm season typically peaks in early to mid-September. Two reasons are behind the busy forecast: The near record-breaking warm sea surface temperatures in much of the North Atlantic can strengthen hurricanes. And the expected development of a La Niña in the Pacific tends to weaken wind shear – the change in wind speed with height that can tear apart hurricanes. La Niña’s much stronger effects can override any impacts associated with the Atlantic Niña. Exacerbating the problem: Global warming The past two years have seen exceptionally high ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and around much of the world’s oceans. The two Niñas are likely to contribute some cooling relief for certain regions, but it may not last long. In addition to these cycles, the global warming trend caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions is raising the baseline temperatures and can fuel major hurricanes .

        "article_text": "Getty Images The prime minister has called it an “energy security crisis” and signalled a review of New Zealand’s electricity market as wholesale prices spike and industries suffer. And he’s right – this year has seen pricing turmoil. August saw daily averages ranging between NZ$164.52 and $853.57 per megawatt hour (MWh). By comparison, August 2023 saw a maximum daily average price of $168.43 per MWh. The Electricity Authority attributes this to a shortage of gas combined with low rain and inflows into our hydro lakes. The latter is a major concern. Storage levels are now around 800 gigawatt hours (GWh) less than the minimum levels in 2023, and more than 1,000GWh less than the historical mean for this time of year. This is happening in the face of climate change, higher risk of dry years , and high projected growth in electricity demand. Electricity demand and generation scenarios released recently by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment show this growth could be up to 82%, with a peak demand of between 9.1 and 12.5 gigawatts by 2050. However, with greater electrification needed to decarbonise the economy, and aspirations to phase out all fossil fuels by 2030, some scenarios indicate the demand will be at least two to three times more. Of course, this means more generation capacity will be needed – 20 to 30 gigawatts above the current ten. The question is, can New Zealand do it? Doubled capacity by 2030 The energy industry has been responding to these market signals, as highlighted in the government’s latest generation investment survey . Committed and actively pursued projects will double generation capacity by the end of the decade. This will come largely from solar (6.4GW) and onshore wind (2.9GW), with smaller contributions from geothermal (0.6GW) and grid-scale batteries (0.6GW). The first 35-megawatt battery facility was commissioned at Huntly this year. And battery capacity is important for stablising the grid and meeting peak demands. However, batteries will not address long-term storage of weeks and months, which is the focus of the NZ Battery Project . The projected lesser investment in battery technology indicates a greater need to use hydropower capacity to compensate for the variability of solar and wind generation. This “firming” of supply is based on the percentage of the year that a generation facility will provide power. For utility-scale solar it ranges between 19% and 26%, and for onshore wind between 33% and 55%. Modelling by the Electricity Authority provides further insight on the firming that will be required. The analysis shows solar generation may be below 10% of the total capacity for 60% of the time. It will be above 50% of the overall capacity for 14% of the time. Wind generation may be below 10% of the total capacity for 5% of the time, and above 50% of the capacity for 9% of the time over the entire country. Renewables can meet future demand Still, by 2030 we can expect around 11.5 terrawatt hours (TWh) a year from the new solar projects, and around 10.1TWh from the onshore wind projects. In total, this is about half the current yearly electricity demand. Over the past decade, the country’s hydropower assets generated between 24 and 26TWh per year . So, to reach 100% renewable supply by 2030 (assuming biomass replaces coal at Huntley) will mean replacing between 3.5 and 5.6TWh of gas generation. The battery capacity being developed won’t offset all of the gas generators currently used to respond to peak demands. If all of the batteries being developed participated in the market for four hours a day, they could provide around 1TWh over a year. On a yearly basis, then, New Zealand can generate more than 47TWh from solar, wind and hydro, with some firming from the grid-scale batteries. That excludes the other baseload generators – geothermal, co-generation (where electricity is generated alongside heat production at industrial sites such as paper mills) and biomass. In short, we should be able to meet our aspirations and the projected growth in energy demand by 2030. Winter price spikes still likely The challenge will be seasonal and daily power variations. The Electricity Authority analysis indicates wind generation should be reasonably consistent over the year. But there is an overall tendency to generate more during the day, typically peaking in the afternoons. Solar generation, of course, will also peak in the early afternoons. But in winter it will generate a third less than in summer. This is important, given the risk of \ndepleting hydro lake storage and running out of sufficient generation capacity in the grid. The electricity system will need to cater for the lower solar generation in winter when hydro storage is at its lowest. Morning and evening demand can be addressed, to some extent, with the rollout of rooftop solar , with batteries to store the solar electricity generated, augmented by the grid to charge the batteries if the sun doesn’t shine. If the solar systems are managed collectively as a virtual power plant , it has been shown winter peak events can be addressed by feeding electricity back into the grid when needed. Nevertheless, with solar and wind offering lower market prices, we can probably expect wholesale prices to stabilise at reasonably low levels from the end of September to early May in a year without drought spells. But winter may well still see price spikes if we don’t address seasonal storage. Scrapping most of the NZ Battery Project, as others have observed , may well prove shortsighted.

        "article_text": "Given the days of political pageantry at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago have come to an end, it’s an opportune time to examine parallels to past conventions — particularly those in the Windy City, a locale that has long been the grounds for historic political coronations. In the decades following Abraham Lincoln’s nomination in 1860 , Chicago became a convention hotspot for both Republicans and Democrats . Politicians that include Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were nominated as their parties’ presidential candidates in the city. While the Republicans have held more conventions in Chicago to date, they haven’t held one there since 1960, when Nixon first ran for president. That’s likely because the state of Illinois is a longtime Democratic stronghold . But whether they’ve been held in Chicago or elsewhere, Vanderbilt University historian Nicole Hemmer says conventions used to take place “in smoke-filled rooms by just the elites… [where] powerful party leaders needed to gather in the same place to decide who the nominee should be.” Times have changed in the 21st century. A new era Those who oversaw this year’s Democratic National Convention included Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson , a former public school teacher and fierce advocate for racial equality. There are few similarities between Johnson and former Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, the pugilistic police supporter and Democratic Party kingmaker who notoriously ordered “shoot-to-kill” edicts on protesters at the 1968 Chicago convention. With the ongoing war in Gaza, there were certain parallels between the 2024 convention and the 1968 event, since a major war is raging again halfway around the world . But there are some key differences, most notably the fact that no U.S. ground troops are deployed in the region, notwithstanding many U.S. military bases located in places nearby. 2024 not as tumultuous as 1968 The whole world was watching the Democratic National Convention in 1968 , but was that the case for either the Democratic or Republican conventions in 2024? And did Americans care as much as they did in 1968? Thousands of demonstrators showed up to protest the Democratic convention in 1968, and hundreds were arrested . Protesters included predominantly white college students from the Students for a Democratic Society, sexually free “Yippies,” Black Panther Party members and Puerto Rican Young Lords . All opposed police brutality and the war in Vietnam. Their demonstrations followed a tumultuous spring in Chicago, when its west side erupted in anger over racial inequality and the assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis, Tenn . The Republican convention in Miami earlier that summer, meanwhile, was largely peaceful and orderly.

Though a tactical defeat for the North Vietnamese fighting the U.S.-backed south, the offensive led to a tremendous amount of scrutiny about American tactics in the Vietnam War. American GIs were increasingly coming home in body bags — 3,800 alone during the offensive . Along with the ongoing domestic unrest, the first few months of 1968 were exceedingly tumultuous — arguably much more chaotic than 2024. War as an issue: 1968 vs 2024 Thousands also descended upon Chicago in 2024 to protest America’s support of Israel’s attack on Gaza, but only dozens — not hundreds — were arrested by mid-week. The focus of the convention was not the war in Gaza. By comparison, the 1968 Democratic convention was heavily focused on the Vietnam War , given the anti-war platforms of Democratic contender Eugene McCarthy and the late Robert F. Kennedy, the party front-runner who was assassinated down two months earlier following a campaign speech . Lyndon B. Johnson’s heir apparent, Hubert Humphrey, won the party’s nomination before later losing to Republican Richard Nixon in the 1968 presidential election . But the Vietnam War and its impact on American life remained on centre stage. Kamala Harris’s candidacy, on the other hand, hasn’t dealt with any major internal party policy differences moving toward the election in November — and a stand-off with MAGA Republicans . And regardless of who wins in November, it isn’t likely the war in Gaza will be a major focal point for the American public — polls suggest inflation is by far their biggest concern . Conventions have changed, but still matter Conventions are certainly not decided by a bunch of white men smoking in closed rooms anymore. But even though representation has improved vastly from earlier eras, as well as more transparent processes of delegate selection and nominations, there can still be a sense that things have already been decided once conventions roll around. In fact, since at least the 1970s, tickets have largely been determined before the conventions begin . Both major parties in 2024 ran their conventions with the nominee already decided for all intents and purposes, though the Democrats cut it close by shifting dramatically to Harris earlier this summer after President Joe Biden, under pressure from the party, opted not to run for a second term. The year 1952 was the last time a presidential nominee — Democrat Adlai Stevenson — needed more than one ballot for the nomination at the convention, held, once again, in Chicago. He won in the third round of voting to become the nominee, but lost to Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in the presidential election. Still, contemporary observers argue that conventions are still important and allow for some political movements to make an impact. Marquette University politics professor Julia Azari explains : “If we look at the history of modern conventions, it’s tempting to dismiss the large, in-person gatherings of power players from around the country as pageantry. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that conventions have played an important role for some wings of the party, who may disagree with party leadership and want to attract media attention for themselves.” She points to the critical 1964 Democratic convention, held in the midst of the Civil Rights era, when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) challenged the all-white delegation from Mississippi , since Black people had been banned from party meetings in the state, where voting restrictions also prevented many from casting ballots in elections. By the time the Democratic convention of 1968 rolled around, a group of former MFDP delegates succeeded at being the sole Mississippi delegates to the DNC. Looking ahead Sixty years later in 2024 and in the wake of both the Republican and Democratic conventions, similar movements that seek to end wars, address environmental catastrophe, fight for reproductive rights or end racial inequality will hopefully continue to find openings at conventions to have their voices heard. Perhaps future conventions will run more virtually, as was the case in 2020 when both parties were forced to go entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Maybe there will be reforms to the primary system of selection or to campaign finance measures that are troublesome to some voters. Either way, convention season will continue to both offend and excite those of us who follow politics closely as we consider the past, present and future of these critical events.

        "article_text": "When Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate, the governor of Minnesota and former advisor to his school’s gay-straight alliance student club was instantly compared with his Republican counterpart, J.D. Vance. There are many differences between these two men. But against a backdrop of raging culture wars in the US, it has been their views on gender equality and women’s rights that have animated public discussions. Vance grabbed the headlines with statements about “childless cat ladies” not being fit for politics. He attacked Harris and other women and LGBTQ+ people without biological children, amplifying conservative gender norms that value women only as mothers. His statements built on a speech he gave in 2021 when he expressed his sympathies for the far-right politics of the Hungarian prime minister, Victor Orbán. In it he described childlessness as a “civilizational crisis” in the USA. Walz , on the other hand, has been spotlighted for his support for LGBTQ+ people and the right to abortion, which he cemented in Minnesota after the roll-back of Roe vs Wade . Opponents have attacked Walz as “ Tampon Tim ” – drawing on his trans-inclusive support for free menstrual products in all public school toilets – and put his support for gender equality front and centre. These differences between the vice-presidential candidates highlight how misogyny in politics fuels the rollback of important rights and democratic freedoms . But it also shows how important it is for male politicians to step up to support rights of women and LGBTQ+ people – not least because men continue to dominate political institutions in most parts of the word. Privately pro-feminist In a year when a record 3.7 billion people head to the polls across the globe – and will likely be exposed to political messaging that threatens gender equality – voices of men like Walz have an important role to play in advancing gender equality. But many men in politics keep their feminist beliefs or sympathies for gender equality a secret. Only a handful of men in positions of political leadership, among them Canada’s Justin Trudeau , Liberia’s George Weah , and Barack Obama in the US, have even been prepared to publicly call themselves feminist. But why? In our recent study at ODI , we partnered with research teams in Colombia , Liberia and Malaysia to ask male politicians who either identify as feminists or support gender equality what motivates them to take up the agenda. We also set out to identify what critical factors prevent them from speaking out in support of these goals, such their views of feminism, perceived religious and cultural views of their voters, and the political cultures of their parties. We learned that many pro-gender equality men in politics are drawn to the agenda because of the women in their lives, whose experience of discrimination drives their sense of injustice or whose perseverance brings admiration and support. Others may have their own social justice experience, for example as queer people, or feel a sense of moral obligation. But this is often not enough to overcome concerns about the political and social costs they may face for their proclaimed feminism or allyship. Some of these costs remain rooted in the myths that feminism is about women’s domination over men. Voters around the world, including in the US, are influenced by the demonisation of feminism spread by influencial people who oppose feminism and gender equality such as Vance and other proponents of Project 2025 , backed by extremely well-funded networks . As a result, feminism is still seen as “a dirty word” – as one of our respondents put it. In many parts of the world, it is often misrepresented as a western, colonial imposition incompatible with local religious and cultural norms. In fact, women’s rights activists and feminists in many parts of the world have been calling for equity and equality for centuries. But anti-feminist discourses are not the only obstacles. Political party practices and a widespread culture of misogyny also play a huge role. Lack of peer support or fear of repercussions for calling out colleagues’ misogyny is part and parcel of most political parties and institutions, which have been built to suit men’s lives and the dominant masculine, patriarchal norms that devalue women as leaders. What can be done? Our political systems, the US and UK included, urgently need changing if we want to ensure equal representation of all people in their diversity. We must recognise and transform formal and informal rules of politics that make misogynist attacks by men such as Vance or Donald Trump an accepted cost of doing politics for women. We must normalise male allies and feminists who are willing to put their political capital behind the fight for women’s rights and LGBTQ+ freedoms. Our research suggests three ways to do this. First, we need to bring men in power on a journey of critical reflection about what it means to be a man. There are many organisations that have successfully worked with men to help them realise that challenging patriarchal norms benefits everyone, because the constraints of patriarchy limit the human potential of all people – men included. Second, we need to create more opportunities for male politicians to learn how to be allies and feminists. For example, we can connect them with men like Walz who can serve as sources of inspiration. We can encourage them to form peer-to-peer networks where they can be comfortable speaking about feminist issues, and to work with feminist civil society organisations to stay accountable to feminist goals. Above all, sustainable solutions lie with transforming how people view gender equality and the types of policies and politicians they demand. Investing in gender-transformative education can over time create a political environment where equitable and just politics becomes the obvious choice for men – and where men like Walz can confidently and safely demand reproductive rights and human dignity for all people.

        "article_text": "Henry in 1540, by Hans Holbein the Younger. Made with Canva In 1534, King Henry VIII infamously broke away from the Catholic Church, becoming the head of the Church of England. Following this, two lesser-known acts were passed, the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 and the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1539 (also known as the “two Acts of Dissolution”). These acts were the legal instruments of what is now known as the dissolution of the monasteries , a long process throughout which the hundreds of priories, convents, friaries, and other religious houses which fell under the English monarch’s rule saw their holdings confiscated by the Crown. In doing so, Henry unwittingly set in motion a series of events that would forever change how scholars of English history would access the primary sources used in research. Because monasteries had served various roles throughout history , the dissolution had wide-ranging consequences. It changed the landscape of England, with religious buildings slowly entering private hands – but it also changed the scholarly landscape. Many of Britain’s early historians came from monasteries (often in the form of chroniclers), including Gerald of Wales, Bede the Venerable and Roger Bacon. As record-keepers, they also preserved the primary sources that continue to be studied by researchers today. Manuscripts, like the religious houses’ other possessions, slowly changed hands in the decades following the dissolution. The king took several manuscripts for himself and more were taken and hidden by former members of the orders, or local inhabitants. Likely thousands disappeared. The extent of the loss, while difficult to estimate, was extensively researched by Anglo-Saxonist and palaeographer (handwriting analysis expert) Neil Ripley Ker in his book, Medieval Libraries of Great Britain which was first published in 1941. This research is now available as a continually updated database through the combined efforts of current scholars. Where did the manuscripts go? Over the past decades, bibliographical research has shown that some were gathered by local, and often little-known, collectors. As for the rest, the writings of contemporary antiquaries (the people interested in the material remains of the past) provide precious information on what existed before the dissolution took place, how much disappeared, and how. John Leland by Thomas Charles Wageman (1824). National Portrait Gallery From 1533, English poet and antiquary John Leland undertook the arduous task of inventorying the most important manuscripts from the monastic houses, listing his work to date in a then-unpublished address commonly known as the Newe Yeares Gyfte , in 1546. Meanwhile, Leland’s associate John Bale compiled a Summary of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, founded upon Leland’s work and first published in Latin in 1548, for which the preparatory notes survive in Oxford’s Bodleian Library. Bale’s preface to the Newe Yeares Gyfte tells us that many of the manuscripts ended up cut up for use as candlesticks or boot polishing cloth, some were sold to foreign nations, and many to book binders. Such recycling had already taken place in the past. The membrane (treated animal skin, also known as parchment or vellum) from which most manuscripts were made could be reused to make new books , notably as binding material, and also had less obvious but not less useful afterlives. It would continue for many years to come, too. Notably, one of the copies of the Magna Carta allegedly had to be rescued from a tailor’s shop in 1629. The Magna Carta in question found its way into the collection of antiquary Sir Robert Cotton. Like other collectors before him, Cotton sought to preserve the witnesses of British history, in particular, the now-dispersed monastic manuscripts. His collection still survives today, as the Cotton manuscripts became one of the foundational collections of the British Library. Robert Cotton by Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen (c. 1629). Trinity College, Cambridge The dissolution itself came at a turning point in historical methods. The 16th century saw the spreading through England of a new intellectual movement coming from Italy, where it had begun over a century earlier: humanism. Renaissance humanism was concerned (at first) with the study of the classical world, eventually producing a new culture of learning involving the re-evaluation of historical sources (including the aforementioned manuscripts). On the continent, this often involved consulting the texts in the monasteries themselves . In England, where the monasteries no longer existed, these sources found their ways into the hands of the scholar-collectors who wished to use them, like Matthew Parker and Cotton. Neither Parker nor Cotton limited themselves to gathering these documents. Their libraries were the centre of research circles, which used, edited, and sometimes published original manuscripts using another continental creation – the printing press. While antiquaries were not necessarily historians, and have generally been considered more interdisciplinary , their work facilitated historical research through both the preservation and the dissemination of primary sources. Historical research has evolved a lot since the 16th century. The sources saved from destruction or dispersion at the time of the dissolution have been read, re-read, translated, studied, and contextualised in many ways since the days of the early antiquaries. Henry VIII may have never intended to endanger these manuscripts. However, it is indisputable that the dissolution had a profound effect on English and indeed British scholarship, marking the minds of budding humanistic historians, and giving them unprecedented access to original documents. Besides its impact on the historiography of its time, the dissolution could have drastically changed the sources we continue to use. Without the preservationist impulse of collectors, the surviving manuscripts may have well disappeared into tailor and cobbler shops, never to be seen again. More than just a story of loss and destruction, the dissolution is also the story of efforts, both big and small, collective and individual, to preserve a country’s heritage in a time of great change and uncertainty.

With more than 3,000 shows being performed, no one person could ever have seen them all, but as a maker and critic of political theatre I was most interested in finding performances that said something significant about our world today – and I wasn’t disappointed. From climate anxiety to Gaza and the culture wars, here are some of the most talked-about shows and themes from the festival. 1. Climate In my roundup of last year’s Fringe offerings , I lamented the shortage of plays about the climate. Happily, this year has been a different story. Many shows explored related issues, including a play about climate activism ( Me For You ), a stand-up show about eco-activism ( Stuart Goldsmith: Spoilers ) and a multimedia concert on the climate crisis ( The Seas Are Rising: Stories of a Climate in Crisis ). But two shows stood out from the rest. First, a co-production of the Daisy Hall play Bellringers by Atticist, Ellie Keel Productions and Hampstead Theatre. A lyrical and subtly surreal vision of two bell-ringers living in the ruins of climate breakdown, Jessica Lazar’s stylish production will be at Hampstead Theatre later this year for those who missed it this time around. Second, performance artist Tom Bailey’s show Vigil , is a poetic exploration of the ruins left by biodiversity collapse and climate change. In a devastating production, Bailey attempts to perform as 26,000 endangered species in under an hour. Bailey will be performing the sequel to this production at the Greenwich and Docklands International Festival this weekend . 2. Gaza Understandably, a number of shows at this year’s Fringe responded to the ongoing genocide in Gaza. This included two previously performed fringe shows about Palestine revived for the festival. The Shroud Maker , written and directed by Palestinian theatre maker Ahmed Masoud in 2018, is a darkly comic meditation about an 80-year-old Palestinian woman making shrouds for the dead. Meanwhile Khawla Ibraheem and Oliver Butler’s A Knock on the Roof , originally performed in 2015, presents an unexpectedly comic account of a Gazan woman’s efforts to avoid aerial bombardments. Meanwhile, Nadav Burstein’s new play Rebels and Patriots , offered a starkly different perspective. Produced by the Israeli-Palestinian British theatre company Floating Shed, it tells the story of four Israel Defense Forces conscripts who experience, in different ways, the devastating psychological impact of war. Elsewhere Nick Cassenbaum’s two-hander comedy heist, REVENGE: After the Levoyah , while not directly about Gaza, shed light on the subject by tackling antisemitism. Imagining a kidnap attempt on former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, REVENGE offers an unexpectedly light-hearted exploration of the difficulties wrought by inter-generational trauma within the Jewish community. 3. Protest This year also saw a number of shows exploring themes of protest and revolution. Lessons on Revolution is a meditative piece of documentary theatre about the 1968 student occupation of London School of Economics (LSE). Combining verbatim and multimedia performance, it revives the story of Marshall Bloom’s refusal to tolerate LSE’s alleged complicity in Ian Smith’s racist regime in what was then Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), asking in the process what lessons might be taken from this today. Apphia Campbell’s Through the Mud , meanwhile, chronicles the lives of two women: Assata Shakur, who was a member of the Black Liberation Army in the US in the 1970s, and a young woman involved in the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014. Bringing together blues and performance, Through the Mud offers a harrowing but ultimately galvanising insight into the ongoing fight for black liberation in America. 4. Gender As last year, the impact of the ongoing cultural wars on the transgender community has been a significant recurring theme in works contrarily celebrating trans resistance. Two shows stood out for their exploration of these themes. Ugly Sisters by Charli Cowgill and Laurie Ward, explores an interaction between Germaine Greer and a trans woman that took place shortly after the publication of The Female Eunuch in 1970. Through drag and dance, Cowgill and Ward offer a provocative but also surprisingly sympathetic insight into the world of gender-critical feminism. This show has a post-festival run at the New Diorama in September . TESTO is a one-person show based on interviews with people who have taken testosterone during the process of gender transitioning. Combining lip-sync, verbatim theatre and movement to explore bodily autonomy, it’s a lurid and labyrinthine journey into the experience of transitioning. Beyond this, a number of shows explored the theme of gender more widely. Josie Dale-Jones’s A Little Inquest Into What We Are All Doing Here explores the censorious nature of contemporary discourse on sex and gender issues. Show Pony is a high-octane show about gender and ageing, in which three performers reflect on the discrimination experienced by women working in the circus industry. And Furiozo: Man Looking for Trouble is a ferocious and highly entertaining clown show about toxic masculinity and rage. 5. A global festival Lastly, as befits an international festival of this nature, a number of shows offered insights into other struggles and conflicts across the globe. Two in particular stood out. First, director Christiane Jatahy’s return to the Edinburgh International Festival with After the Silence , based on Itamar Vieira Junior’s novel Torto Arado (2019). Jatahy’s production weaves a tapestry of film, performance and music to portray bitter struggles around the fight for land, slavery’s legacy and structural racism in Brazil. Lastly, food writer Atoosa Sepehr’s show My English Persian Kitchen tells the story of an Iranian woman escaping an abusive husband before arriving in the UK, in the process exploring continuing struggles around gender inequality in Iran. Sepehr’s play will be on at the Soho Theatre in September and October . Looking for something good?

        "article_text": "Ukraine’s three-week incursion has been countered recently by an intensifying Russian drone campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure. Russian troops have also made steady gains in the battle for the strategic logistics hub of Pokrovsk in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, in the background, the diplomatic wrangling in the more than 30-month-long war has also increased. But there’s no sign of a breakthrough or an indication that we might be seeing peace negotiations any time soon. In fact, intensified diplomatic efforts on both sides to shore up international support indicate a continuing lack of willingness to compromise. On the Russian side, a three-day visit by Chinese premier Li Qiang, starting on August 21, was the highest profile such engagement since the presidential summit between the Chinese and Russian leaders, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, in Beijing in May. Li then went on to Minsk for meetings with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, and the country’s prime minister, Roman Golovchenko. Little of substance was discussed beyond declarations of intent about further strengthening ties and maintaining high levels of cooperation . But the meetings sent a clear signal of continuing Chinese support to Russia and its ally Belarus. This signal was reinforced a day after Li’s departure for Minsk when a high-level Chinese military delegation, led by the commander of the ground forces of the Chinese army, Li Qiaoming, arrived in Moscow for talks with Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin. According to the Russian defence ministry, the two sides “reached agreements during the meeting on further enhancing cooperation between the ground forces in various spheres”. Modi manoeuvring While Li was shuttling from Moscow to Minsk, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, arrived in Kyiv on August 23. Modi is the first Indian head of state to visit since Ukraine’s independence more than 30 years ago. It’s particularly significant for Ukraine because of India’s complex relationships with Moscow, Beijing and the west, and its traditional role as power broker with considerable influence in the developing world. In July, Modi made the first foreign trip of his third term as prime minister to Moscow, trying to shore up relations with India’s long-term ally Russia. Modi’s visit to Moscow was badly received in Ukraine and among India’s partners in the west . But Modi’s recent trip to Kyiv suggests that neither is all well in the China-led pro-Russian camp. Before visiting Moscow, Modi had skipped the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on July 3-4 in Astana, Kazakhstan. This has partly to do with continuing border tensions between Beijing and New Delhi. The ever-closer relationship between Moscow and Beijing probably deprives India of a traditional ally in its rivalry with China, and – equally worrying for New Delhi – Pakistan . India may now be Russia’s largest oil buyer , but the country is reducing its military dependence on Russia by diversifying its supplies of arms. This has gone hand in hand with strengthened ties between India, the US, Japan and Australia in the so-called Quad . The Quad is an important component in Washington’s efforts to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, including efforts to pull India away from Chinese-led blocs such as the SCO and the Brics group of emerging economies. To be clear, Modi has so far refused to condemn Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. And he has not yet endorsed Zelensky’s peace formula for an end to the war. But, while India did not sign up to the final communique of Zelensky’s “Summit on Peace in Ukraine” in Switzerland three months ago, at least it sent a delegation, headed by the deputy national security adviser, Pavan Kapoor. During his visit to Kyiv, Modi reiterated the need for dialogue to end the war and offered his help to initiate peace talks. Zelensky, meanwhile, expressed his support for the idea of India hosting a follow up to the summit in Switzerland. Recent events may not put India firmly in the camp of Ukraine’s pro-western backers, but the visit sends an important signal that New Delhi is probably less committed to endorsing Russia’s and China’s views on the war. Given India’s traditionally influential role in the global south, it could also help Ukraine build support among countries there that have been particularly badly affected by rising food, fertiliser and energy prices as a result of the war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, also scored several points in relations with its western allies. On August 23, US president Joe Biden announced a new military aid package worth US$125 million (£95 million). This primarily aims to bolster Ukraine’s air defences and to top up Kyiv’s supplies of ammunition for the ground war. On the same day, the US also imposed new sanctions against some 400 companies and individuals. While this group includes a large number of Chinese entities accused of supporting the Russian war effort through the export of dual-use goods. In keeping with efforts to pull India further away from Russia and China, no Indians have been sanctioned. Given the track record of sanctions so far, it’s unlikely to deal a knock-out blow to the Russian economy. Neither will it persuade Beijing to back away from Moscow in any substantial way. But it is likely to feature prominently on the agenda of White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s visit to China at the end of August. Taken together, neither Kyiv nor Moscow have made any earth-shattering recent gains or losses on the diplomatic front. But the careful manoeuvring by India also suggests that things remain in flux as all sides and their backers try to shore up support on the international stage. If nothing else, it does indicate that they all think that there is still much to play for – on and off the battlefield.

        "article_text": "Soon after the closing of the London 2012 Olympic Games, Channel 4 began promoting its Paralympic coverage with the strapline : “Thanks for the warm-up”. It followed up with its biggest ever marketing campaign , “Meet the Superhumans”, that garnered critical acclaim . The Paralympics were beamed to more than 100 countries, eventually drawing 3.8 billion viewers. At the closing ceremony Lord Coe, president of the London 2012 Organising Committee, said people would never think of disability in the same way again. Research undertaken after the Paralympics revealed that 65% of Britons agreed London delivered a breakthrough in the way people with an impairment are viewed. Now, on the eve of the Paris 2024 Paralympics, a new exhibition documents the last 70 years of para sport. Paralympic History: From Integration in Sport to Social Inclusion (1948-2024) begins with the early community created through the Stoke Mandeville Games of 1948 – which opened on the same day as the London 1948 Olympic Games, foregrounding the post-war needs of injured soldiers. This led to the establishment of shared principles and aspirations, culminating in the first Paralympic Games in Rome in 1960. In the years that followed the Games have become a global brand showcasing boundary-pushing technologies and exceptional human performance. Visitors encounter a copy of the document that sets out the origin of the International Paralympic Committee in 1989. Also included is the documentation from the Court of Arbitration decision in 2008, which outlines why South African runner Oscar Pistorius was entitled to compete in the London 2012 Olympics wearing his Össur Cheetah Flex-Foot. This was the first time in history that an athlete with a prosthesis had done so, marking a new chapter in how people thought about disability in sport . These documents may not make for exciting exhibits, but they do underscore the importance given to legal transformations that have enabled the development of para sport . Were it not for these landmark historical changes the Paralympics would not have become the global event that it is today, with a growing media impact . The establishment of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) was key because it brought an organised strategy to the future of the Paralympics and greater alignment with the International Olympic Committee. Representing para athletes The phrase “not disabled, differently abled” features prominently in this exhibition, which reveals how the London 2012 Paralympic Games ushered in a new era for para sport. While the presence of Pistorius was one aspect, crucially, it was how the newly appointed Paralympic broadcaster, Channel 4, told the story – leading to a new chapter in the global coverage of para sport. Though Channel 4’s memorable 2012 Superhumans campaign broke new ground, some critics found it unhelpful . But the broadcaster was determined to articulate why it was necessary. Research commissioned by Channel 4 revealed that many viewers saw para sport as disability first and excellence second: 59% of people said they watched the Paralympics to “see athletes overcoming their disabilities”, and just 37% said they watched it for “exciting sporting competition”. In response, and to encourage viewers to see para sport differently, Channel 4’s Paris 2024 campaign shows Paralympians overcoming forces such as “gravity, friction and time – the dispassionate elements and unchangeable forces of our world that make no exception for any athlete, regardless of disability”. In a public statement , Yiannis Excharcos, CEO of the Olympic Broadcasting Services, warned broadcasters against sexist coverage of women’s sport at the 2024 Games, reflecting the view that unconscious bias still leads to such reporting. The same applies now to Paralympics coverage: patronising attitudes are not acceptable. In this sense, it remains critical that broadcasters harness the potential to change public perceptions. But there is a deeper story of para culture unfolding in Paris. The Panthéon exhibition is just one of many projects funded by France’s ministry of culture that address the theme through various artistic practices, including dance, theatre and the visual arts. When visitors attend the Games in Paris they will see performances by artists that highlight para culture and the wider excellence of differently abled performance culture in France. In this sense, the hard work of social change that is woven into the Paris 2024 Games – both Olympic and Paralympic – is not just what is shown by broadcasters on the field of play, but a feature of the wider public environment in which the Games are being held. This is why it is so critical that the Games are a place for people to converge in physical spaces and reflect on this experience to further imagine what the future could be like if societies could make space to accommodate differences more effectively. In Channel 4’s campaign for Paris 2024, the broadcaster reminds its audiences how it “exists to represent unheard voices, challenge the mainstream and stir the metaphorical pot”. This Paralympian spirit is perhaps what makes its contribution so distinct, but also why Channel 4 leads the way in what sports broadcasting can or should be. Yet the broadcaster’s approach also reinforces the idea that para sport is different and needs specific efforts to address the remaining inequalities that continue to limit its progress. Without this commitment and attention, the rate of transformation and acceptance of para sport sought by the IPC and its community will not progress swiftly. One of the other featured athletes in the Panthéon exhibition is Aimee Mullins who, perhaps better than anyone else, captures the themes of Paris 2024. As an icon of Paralympic track and field, Mullins has also become a fashion icon who embodies the positive affirmation that “difference is beautiful”. And this message, championed by this Paralympic exhibition, is perhaps the strongest to come out of Paris 2024. Difference doesn’t require us to make comparisons in order to evaluate worth, but to recognise that it is an inherent feature of a progressive, equitable and well-rounded society.

        "article_text": "Alexander Dubrovsky As we grieve the loss of a pet, we may not be the only ones feeling the pain. Research is showing that cats who are left behind when another animal in their home dies could be mourning along with us. Grief is a well-documented human response to loss – but its roots may be far more ancient as some scientists believe it evolved in extinct species of humans. Corvids – members of the crow family – primates, and marine mammals like dolphins and whales, have all been observed to change their behaviour when one of their own dies, from carrying dead offspring for days, to staying close by the body, as if keeping vigil. One theory is that grief is a by-product of the natural stress response to separation seen in social animals . According to this idea, distress and searching behaviour probably evolved to encourage animals to reunite with lost group members, which was beneficial for survival. These responses persist when separation is permanent, like in death, leading to the enduring pain of grief. While there’s plenty of research on how losing a pet affects humans, much less is known about how cats cope with loss, something recent research by US-based comparative psychologists Brittany Greene and Jennifer Vonk investigated. Unlike typical social species, the cat’s wild ancestor was largely solitary. However, domestication has reshaped their behaviour , enabling them to live in groups and form social bonds. Green and Vonk’s study suggests that cats can grieve the loss of a fellow pet. In their study of 452 cats, many displayed signs of distress, such as increased attention-seeking, vocalising and reduced appetite, following the death of a companion. The study found that the strength of the bond between the animals, their time spent together, and daily interactions were key factors in this grief-like behaviour. Cats showed altered behaviour after their companion died. Julia Cherk This study builds on earlier research by animal welfare researcher Jessica Walker and her team in 2016, which examined how cats and dogs react to the loss of a companion. Walker’s study, conducted in New Zealand and Australia, found that 75% of surviving pets showed noticeable behavioural changes, with cats showing increased affection, clinginess and anxiety-related vocalisations. It should be noted that both studies relied on owner perceptions to assess changes in pet behaviour, which presents a potential problem. While pet owners are often the most attuned to subtle changes in their animals, their observations may also be influenced by their own grief and emotional state. Is it really grief? There is an alternative explanation for changes in behaviour the owners in studies observed after a companion’s death. The presence of a deceased animal can signal danger in the environment , causing pets to change their behaviour as a safety measure, rather than being a grief response. Although this hasn’t been studied in domestic cats, 2012 research on western scrub-jays revealed that seeing a dead member of their species can prompt alarm calls and behaviour aimed at avoiding danger, much like how they would react to a predator. Similarly, a 2006 study on bumblebees found that they were less likely to visit flowers that contained a freshly killed bee or its scent, probably reducing their own risk of being attacked. This suggests that what we interpret as grief might, in some cases, be a survival instinct. Some behaviour the owners in the studies noticed after the death of a companion, such as their cat hiding or seeking higher vantage points, could support this idea. A question you might be asking is whether cats mourn the deaths of their owners. Though we would like to think that our cat would mourn our death, at the minute, we simply don’t know. There seems to be little to no research on how cats react to the death of their owner. One unsettling behaviour that has been well documented upon death of an animals’ owner is the consumption of their remains. While cats often get a bad reputation for this, dog lovers should note that both cats and dogs have been known to scavenge human remains. In fact, pet dogs are more frequently documented doing so. Some scientists suggest this behaviour might stem from hunger, but it has also happened when food was plentiful . Another theory, better aligned with the idea of grief, is that scavenging might start as an attempt to revive an unresponsive owner. When nudging or licking doesn’t work, the animal may escalate to nipping or biting in an effort to rouse them . So the jury is still out on whether cats grieve in response to loss, or if are they responding to changes in their environment that we have yet to fully understand.

        "article_text": "On 16 August, Thailand elected its youngest-ever prime minister, the 38-year-old Paetongtarn “Ing” Shinawatra . The daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a dominant and controversial figure in Thai politics, Paetongtarn has led the Pheu Thai (For Thais) party, Thailand’s second-largest party, since 2023. Pundits may be tempted, at first glance, to frame Paetongtarn’s appointment as “fresh energy” and democratic progress. Such a perception is partly explained by a recent institutional change: The senators appointed in 2019 by the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), the governing body of the military junta that ruled from 2014 to 2023, completed their term in June 2024. According to the current 2017 Constitution, the new senate no longer have the right to vote for the prime minister. However, it would be overly optimistic to think that Paetongtarn’s rise to power spells the end of the country’s political woes. Thailand’s politics continue to face headwinds that have persisted for many years. From hope to disillusionment: a year of political turbulence 14 May 2023 marked a turning point in Thai political history. Born from the ashes of the Anakhot Mai party (Future Forward), the social democratic and reformist party Kao Klai (Move Forward) surprised many by garnering more than 14 million votes in the legislative elections, thus achieving a significant victory . The party campaigned on sweeping reforms across multiple areas, including the military, education system, civil bureaucracy, and the lèse-majesté law. They also pledged not to form a coalition with pro-military parties . This unexpected result revived hope for real democratic change in the country and propelled the very popular party leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, as a potential prime minister. But the democratic momentum quickly hit a wall. Despite its popularity, the party Kao Klai faced opposition from conservative parties and the 250 senators appointed in 2019 by the military junta, itself led by putschists Generals Prayut Chan-o-cha and Prawit Wongsuwan. The party failed to form a coalition majority and eventually had to place itself in the opposition, despite their victory at the polls. On 5 September 2023, Srettha Thavisin, a businessman and member of the centre-right Pheu Thai party, was elected prime minister after Pheu Thai struck a deal with pro-military and pro-monarchy factions, betraying the vow to not work with the “uncle parties” . During their first year in government, they achieved very little, with the notable exception of the legalisation of same-sex marriage in December 2023 . The party’s popularity tanked. On 7 August 2024, the Thai Constitutional Court, whose independence is frequently questioned, dissolved the Kao Klai party after it had campaigned to reform Article 112 of the penal code, the crime of lèse-majesté. To the court, the proposal constituted a threat to the Thai political system, where the king is the head of state . As a result of the judgement, the party leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, along with several other leaders, has been banned from any political activity for 10 years. The Constitutional Court also dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin exactly a week later, on 14 August. This time, the decision was motivated by an allegation of serious violation of ethics in the appointment to his cabinet of a legislator previously sentenced for corruption. Bargaining for the return of the Shinawatra dynasty Paetongtarn’s election consolidates the power of the Shinawatra family, a political dynasty that has profoundly marked recent Thai history. Her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, was overthrown by a military coup and went into exile until 2023. Her uncle, Somchai Wongsawat, briefly held the position in 2008 before being dismissed by the Constitutional Court for electoral fraud. Her aunt, Yingluck Shinawatra, prime minister from 2011 to 2014, met a similar fate to Thaksin: Ousted by a new coup , she has since lived in exile in Dubai. If there’s anything to exemplify the tensions running through the country, it’s the Shinawatras’ journey. On the one hand, they have long managed to attract the support of the working class thanks to populist policies , especially in rural areas. On the other, they have been accused, among others, of corruption, nepotism, and an excessive concentration of power. Thaksin Shinawatra appears to have undertaken a major political negotiation from exile in August 2023 . Although sentenced to eight years in prison for corruption and abuse of power, his sentence was quickly commuted to one year by the king of Thailand, just days after his return from exile. Thaksin never spent a single night in prison; instead, he was transferred to a VIP room in a police hospital after complaining of health problems. The mystery surrounding this prolonged hospitalisation, his early release on parole after only one year, and the recent royal pardon that shortens his parole by two weeks all point to a deal struck behind the scenes with the conservative establishment. Paetongtarn’s rise to power confirms the alliance between Pheu Thai and the conservative and pro-military parties. But the long-term coherence and stability of this coalition are questionable. We can’t overlook the risk that Paetongtarn might suffer the same fate as other members of her family who have held power. A long list of political challenges The new prime minister, who has little experience in politics, inherits a complex economic and political situation. She’ll have to grapple with a sluggish Thai economy as well as criticisms for failing to honour certain campaign promises. This is notably in the case of the flagship policy of her predecessor, Srettha Thavisin: the introduction of a digital wallet . Through this system, Thais aged 16 and over would receive a one-time payment of 10,000 baht (260 euros) in digital currency. However, the government is considering rolling back the policy in the coming months, particularly to protect the new prime minister from possible legal repercussions. Indeed, this populist policy is strongly contested, especially by the central bank, due to its reliance on public finances. Moreover, the National Anti-Corruption Commission has already issued a warning that the digital wallet could lead to increased corruption and the government could be held responsible for negligence, similar to how the Rice Pledge program was used against Yingluck. On the political front, the new government faces the challenge of balancing the interests of the various factions making up the ruling coalition. The unprecedented alliance between the Pheu Thai party and its former conservative and pro-military adversaries raises questions about the government’s ability to pass substantial reforms. Despite this alliance, the total support of these parties is not guaranteed, nor is that of conservative voters. Paetongtarn thus finds herself in a precarious position. She risks facing criticism from all sides, which could compromise her ability to govern effectively. Under her father’s shadow Moreover, recent developments have revealed that the true decision-maker in Thailand is not Paetongtarn, but rather her father. He has been increasingly visible at public events and displaying his control over his daughter; evidenced by his own words: “she is not dominated by me, but she is under my control. So what? She is my daughter.” . A petition has already been filed to ban the Pheu Thai Party due to Thaksin’s alleged dominance over the party , which is against the constitution. In three years, new legislative elections will take place. Currently, popular discontent with Pheu Thai does not bode well for a victory. The party will have to confront other conservative parties, including Bhumjaithai (Thai Pride), which is increasingly powerful in the Thai political landscape. This is evidenced by the 150 out of 200 senators affiliated with the Bhumjaithai party appointed in June 2024 through a complex system in which the population does not participate . If Pheu Thai and Bhumjaithai do not have the favour of the people, they can rely on the “baan yai” (big houses). These networks of influence, consisting of rich and powerful families, dominate regional and provincial politics through a system of patronage and clientelism. This “baan yai” system continues to play a crucial role in favour of conservative parties. Furthermore, the new Prachachon ( People’s Party ), formed by former members of the dissolved Kao Klai, promises to constitute a vigorous opposition within Parliament. With 143 MPs, the party, led by 37-year-old entrepreneur Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, intends to pursue the reformist agenda that had attracted a large part of the electorate in 2023. Biased institutions The election of Paetongtarn, despite a certain generational renewal, follows the continuity of a political system dominated by influential families and the military-royalist establishment. The use of judicial institutions and control bodies such as the Constitutional Court and the National Anti-Corruption Commission to sideline reformist voices raises serious questions about the independence of these institutions and the stability of the rule of law in Thailand. The message is clear: profound reforms will not be tolerated , and the popular vote can be circumvented by institutional power. Donning T-shirts proclaiming the French motto of “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity” , there is little doubt today’s reform supporters are resilient and ready to continue the struggle for the Thai democracy. However, with 44 parliamentarians formerly members of Kao Klai currently under investigations that could exclude them from political life, the infernal cycle never seems to stop.

To the court, the proposal constituted a threat to the Thai political system, where the king is the head of state . Born from the ashes of the Anakhot Mai party (Future Forward), the social democratic and reformist party Kao Klai (Move Forward) surprised many by garnering more than 14 million votes in the legislative elections, thus achieving a significant victory .",

        "article_text": "South Africa endured an electricity crisis from 2008 characterised by intermittent rolling blackouts and a growing culture of non-payment. The state-owned utility, Eskom, came to be regarded as the single largest risk to South Africa’s economy. At the end of March 2020 Eskom’s debt stood at R488 billion (US$27.4 billion ). Government has attempted several measures to overcome the country’s energy problems. These have included new Eskom boards, new CEOs, bailouts for Eskom and a National Energy Crisis Committee that includes the private sector. Now it’s trying legislative reform. In mid-August 2024 President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a new law that marks the most significant change to date in the electricity supply industry. The Electricity Regulation Amendment Act is the beginning of the end of Eskom, the near state monopoly that has dominated South Africa’s electricity sector since the 1950s. The law paves the way for Eskom to end its transmission business over the next five years. It seems likely to be a generator for a long time, however: its new coal-fired stations are designed to operate for 50 years .  The new act envisages a hybrid market model, designed to accommodate various kinds of transactions. Competition and market prices are expected to emerge over time. New kinds of businesses are emerging, such as traders in electricity, “prosumers” (consumers that also produce electricity for sale into the grid), electricity market operators and system operators. Ramaphosa promised that: the Act will lead to long-term energy security, a more competitive energy system, more rapid uptake of renewable energy sources, and ultimately lower energy prices for all South Africans. The new law is indeed groundbreaking, and an important step along South Africa’s zig-zag, stop-start path to electricity market reform . But electricity market reform is a process that evolves over years as technologies and markets change. It is not a destination. Based on my 40-odd years in the energy sector, including six on the Eskom board, I believe that on balance, the new law  is good news for electricity market reform. However, there are some matters to be concerned about. Change is hard in South Africa. It has taken 26 bumpy years since the 1998 White Paper to get to this entry point to market reform. It would be naive to expect a smooth ride from here on. Vested interests in and around Eskom and the municipalities will want to cling to their powers. New technologies are disrupting the old way of doing things. There is no national champion driving electricity reform and with weak government there is the risk of reform being diverted elsewhere. A long, hard road Electricity market reform in South Africa has its origins in a White Paper on Energy Policy published in 1998. The first round of efforts to implement this policy and to begin the unwinding of Eskom’s monopoly led to: Eskom being separated into divisions in 2000 the establishment of Electricity Distribution Holdings to own the new Regional Electricity Distributors in 2003 the establishment of the National Energy Regulator of South Africa in 2005 the establishment of the Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme Office in 2006 an Independent System Operator Bill in 2012. But this first attempt at reform petered out by 2015. After a lull of some years, a second round of attempts at market reform was initiated by the Eskom Roadmap published in 2019 . This, along with public pressure from increasing power cuts, led to the Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill being released for public comment in March 2021. After 42 months, the president signed the act on 16 August 2024. What changes are envisaged? Within the next five years a new juristic person, the Transmission System Operator SOC Ltd, is to be created. The foundations of this exist in the form of the National Transmission Company of South Africa, which Eskom has already set up as a wholly owned subsidiary. The role of the new entity will be as follows. As a system operator it will have the task of keeping demand and supply in balance every second of the day and deciding where power is drawn from first. This is where it runs into “player and referee” challenges as it must ensure fair competition between multiple electricity generators: Eskom and privately owned ones. It will be a market operator. This will involve providing a platform for competitive, wholesale or retail buying and selling of electricity. It  will have to establish rules to govern the market (much like stock markets have rules for buying and selling shares). It must ensure that financial settlements between buyers and sellers are settled in a fair, neutral and transparent manner. It will be a central purchasing agency that will provide market support functions. Eskom has been a near monopoly for a long time and is unlikely to give up its market dominance without a fight. There are some provisions in the new act which are intended to protect the market from Eskom dominance. As usual, the devil will be in the detailed regulations and codes. On 19 April 2024, Eskom launched a draft market code for public comment by 30 September 2024. At the same time, the National Energy Crisis Committee launched its description of the market model. Possible brakes on progress Access to transmission and distribution infrastructure will be crucial for a market to operate. Independent generators will need to transport their electricity to their customers. Initially, customers will remain with their existing suppliers but as the electricity markets evolve, retail customers will be able to choose their suppliers. The new act grants “third-party access” to such infrastructure. But that access is not defined. Usually, the first party is the owner of the infrastructure and the second party is its customers. The third party is anyone else. Third-party access usually means that the owner of a natural monopoly can serve its customers first and that any capacity left over can be used by others. The act makes this clear – access can be refused “where it lacks the necessary capacity”. This provision protects incumbents like Eskom and municipalities and could slow down the evolution of market competition. Concerns The new act raises several concerns. A 20-year cap is introduced for the duration of generation, transmission or system operation licences (or a lesser period decided by the national energy regulator). Large power infrastructure such as transmission lines, coal and nuclear generators typically have useful lives of more than 20 years. Investors will want to recover their investments within the 20-year licence period through higher tariffs. After 20 years, customers will have something of a “free ride” as the asset will have been paid for. In contrast, the licence period for long-life distribution assets is left to the regulator to decide. Another major concern is that the act gives the responsible minister new and wide-ranging powers. The minister can decide, for example: to deviate from an integrated resource plan or a transmission development plan if it is in the national interest and when it is “reasonable and justifiable”, without public consultation.  (Previously the national interest was only invoked in land expropriation.) to establish an “energy infrastructure project”, which is not defined, but can include “gas infrastructure”. This curious new type of project appears to contemplate cross-border trade in gas (type unspecified) for gas-to-power but might also be used for new nuclear capacity. As South Africa’s power system increasingly moves to private ownership, investor confidence becomes more important. Wide-ranging ministerial discretion contributes to investor uncertainty. There is a risk that the new act or parts of it may be stillborn as the South African Local Government Association has objected to certain provisions and threatened legal action . Media reports suggest that President Ramaphosa has left the door open to excluding certain provisions . Rod Crompton is employed by the African Energy Leadership Centre at the Wits Business School that received funding from various donors.",

These have included new Eskom boards, new CEOs, bailouts for Eskom and a National Energy Crisis Committee that includes the private sector. The first round of efforts to implement this policy and to begin the unwinding of Eskom’s monopoly led to: Eskom being separated into divisions in 2000 the establishment of Electricity Distribution Holdings to own the new Regional Electricity Distributors in 2003 the establishment of the National Energy Regulator of South Africa in 2005 the establishment of the Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme Office in 2006 an Independent System Operator Bill in 2012.",

        "article_text": "Over the past 17 years, Rwanda has cleared informal settlements to make way for modern urban construction. Kigali’s ambitious city master plan is expected to be fully realised by 2050. But what about the people who are pushed out in the process, and their memories?  Shakirah E. Hudani presents some of their stories in her new book Master Plans and Minor Acts: Repairing the City in Post-Genocide Rwanda. She answers questions about Kigali’s emergence from conflict, and what could be. What has emerged from the state’s vision for Kigali? Kigali was established as a colonial outpost in 1907 by German administrator Richard Kandt. The city became the capital of an independent Rwanda in 1962 but remained mostly an elite hub separated from rural areas of the country, where the majority of the population lived. During the genocide against the Tutsi and soon thereafter, the city became a site of refuge for those fleeing the violence. Ultimately it became a site of resettlement as many returned from around the region and further afield to rebuild the capital. Approximately 60% of Kigali’s population lived in informal settlements in 2012. Conceptual master planning for the city began in 2007-2008 and was initially led by American firm Oz Architects. This process was followed by a more extensive Singaporean designed master plan for the city in 2013. Large areas of the existing city were marked for rezoning and rebuilding by 2040. In readiness, the majority of the city’s informal settlements have been targeted for demolition. Some residents in now demolished areas such as Kiyovu cy’Abakene and others areas like the Bannyahe settlement in Gasabo District have been offered unaffordable housing far from the city centre, their jobs and social networks. The Kigali City master plan has been revised for 2050. Six secondary cities around the country have been replanned too. They have been set up as gateways for Rwanda’s transformation into an urban-led, middle-income country. Planners working on Kigali envisage a green city, connected to investment opportunities for a certain class of Rwandan and for drawing in foreign capital. These aesthetically pleasing plans promise “Kigali Yacu!” (Our Kigali!) . But my research shows that far from being inclusive, these plans do not redress the social and spatial inequalities in the country. About 83% of Rwandans live in rural areas. Research further shows that Rwanda is “ the most unequal country in east Africa ”. Read more: Kampala, Kigali and Addis Ababa are changing fast: new book follows their distinct paths In the aftermath of conflict and genocide, my book argues, planners must pay attention to social equity. Dispossession can undercut bonds of trust and processes of social repair, and create instability. Repair has multiple meanings. Social repair relates to reciprocity between neighbours and social relations around the home and the neighbourhood. It also relates to the repair of the built environment in Kigali and in smaller urban areas. I suggest that more popular alternatives to master-planning must emerge. Citizens of all areas must be centrally involved, rather than just the state and top-down planning expertise.  “Minor acts” of repair centred on place are key to rebuilding an equitable city and restructuring social relations after genocide. What is the cost of this bold authoritarian vision? I started work in Rwanda in 2002, examining the community-based trials taking place after Rwanda’s 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. These Inkiko-Gacaca trials sought to lay the foundation for both grassroots justice and reconciliation in Rwandan society. Yet scholarship has shown that mistrust remains and that, under the surface, reconciliation is an ongoing process. The city master plan erases social memory in urban spaces. It replaces the city’s existing built environment without considering its effects on ideas of healing and conciliation centred on place. Many of my interviewees in older areas of Kigali like Muhima and Nyamirambo  expressed a sense of loss and disorientation about the emerging new contours of the city. They had developed social networks tied to older spaces in the city, to neighbourhoods and routines. For them, the city was not “born again”. Instead it was a site of memory maps. What could Rwanda’s planners do better? Many key planners working on Rwanda’s new cities are architectural and planning experts from overseas. They have little personal experience with the country’s complex history and its contested politics of memory. Rwanda’s cities are hence being designed largely for an elite class of Rwandans and for foreign technocrats and investors. Such problems are common to other cities in the region . But they are  more urgent in a post-conflict, post-genocide space where urban erasure fails to reckon with traumatic memory. Rwandans I interviewed said planning needs to be smaller scale, more gradual, inclusive of all, and more “humane”, as one trader put it. Many stated in different ways that the city is a historical milieu and can’t be remade on a large scale. For instance, one person remarked that one cannot simply replace a whole city, without first reckoning with existing memory and the history that the new city supplants. I met long-term residents of older parts of Kigali who helped each other through informal systems of mutual aid, operating in the private sphere through neighbourly initiatives to repair homes and exchange food. They also shared stories of living in Kigali over time, and the meanings particular roads or places in the neighbourhood had for them. Top-down planning at scale threatens to replace localised memory and place-based sociality. What would a Kigali-for-all look like? According to my study, many Rwandans of all walks of life dream of access to the city and would celebrate a more inclusive vision for urban space. Yet many are unable to access housing and public spaces in Kigali due to lack of affordability and policing that is tough on informality of all kinds. Others still cannot move to urban centres from rural grouped settlements ( imidugudu ), where most of Rwanda’s rural population live, in part because they can’t afford the associated costs. Rather than prescribing particular policies or types of urban design, my book takes the position that these problems must also be viewed from the perspective of social memory and repair and how these coalesce and come to be represented in urban space. Read more: Key models that Kampala needs to consider to manage its urban sprawl Reparative planning approaches take into account incremental and smaller-scale practices of planning. They must consider the history of rupture that has affected Rwanda over time, and address the types of unresolved memory that inhabit its old neighbourhoods and informal settlements. Instead, Rwanda’s state vision presents a bold version of official history that explicitly prioritises unity and compliance, as well as a single narrative of the past. The questions at stake are hence not just planning questions of how to design a better city. My book shows us that we must broaden definitions of planning and repair to consider social repair in urban environments.

        "article_text": "Loving, open communication is key to raising kids who know how to safely navigate online spaces. Ridofranz The United States’ most senior public health official, surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, believes social media platforms should come with warning labels . The United Nations’ education, science and culture agency says smartphones should be banned in schools . Chinese regulators are pushing to limit children’s smartphone use to just two hours a day . These are just a few high profile examples of growing global concerns about the risks young people face when using the internet. Those worries are backed by a large, global body of research . Social media use has been linked to feelings of envy , depression and anxiety among young people all over the world, including those in African countries . This evidence can make for depressing reading, especially if you’re the parent or caregiver of a teenager. Many may be tempted to confiscate their teens’ cellphones, lock away their tablets and keep them as far away from the internet as possible. But that’s neither practical nor helpful in a hyper-connected, digital world. Though we come from different academic disciplines as a children’s rights researcher , a moral philosopher and a clinical researcher , our current work focuses on the same thing: the ethics of new and emerging technologies and their impact . We know that protecting children is a shared responsibility. Government, service providers and education systems all have a role to play. But parents are key. So, drawing from our ongoing research, we have three messages for parents trying to navigate this modern minefield. One, the internet and social media are not all bad for children. Some online spaces may even help young people to manage their mental health . Two, children and teens have rights to access information, share their views and have those views respected. Three, by creating a strong foundation of open, loving and trusting communication, you help your children navigate the risks, identify the ethical pitfalls and enjoy the benefits of social media platforms. Benefits of online spaces While it is true that internet use comes with risks, there’s also evidence that it can benefit young people. For instance, interactive features and user-generated content platforms such as social media, blogs and forums enable social interaction and connection. These online spaces allow children to engage with peers, share interests and build communities. They also provide outlets for creativity and self-expression, helping kids to develop digital literacy skills and shape their identities. Some internet spaces may help children and teens to manage their mental health. The COVID pandemic accelerated the development of digital mental health services like free platforms that connect children to counsellors, chat bots, text tools and apps that offer support for children and parents. Childline South Africa’s free online chat service is one example. Children’s rights Too many societies and communities forget that children, like adults, have rights. In South Africa, for instance, children’s rights are enshrined in section 28 of the constitution . Globally, the Convention on the Rights of Children (which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989) guarantees children’s rights to access information, to freedom of association, to share their thoughts freely and to have their views respected, to health, including mental health, and to privacy, non-discrimination, protection, education and play. More recently, the United Nations issued guidance on children’s rights in the digital environment. Several countries (among them Australia , Brazil , Canada , China and the UK now have online safety legislation aimed at protecting kids and teens. Some parents may wonder why all countries don’t simply make laws to reduce the risks posed by social media platforms. The reality is that it is difficult to implement and enforce these regulations. African countries have been slow to regulate online safety for minors. South Africa is working on a White Paper that aims to protect children from harmful content and ensure that content meets their needs. However, it is still a draft; new legislation and regulation are years away. But there is no need for parents to wait before starting to teach their children how to safely use the internet. Trust and communication Some parents may fear that they don’t have the skills and knowledge to properly support their teens. Just remember that parents find their way around new things all the time: setting boundaries for young children, teaching them to read and write, and, later on, managing adolescent mood swings, discussing sexuality or counselling teens through their first heartbreaks. You can help your kids to use the internet safely. Anna Frank When it comes to safe internet navigation and use, parents and caregivers can help children in two main ways. The first is by prioritising open, trusting and loving communication from when your children are young. Since children are constantly developing, the kinds of things you discuss will shift over time. You can start talking about the internet and social media when you think your children are ready. This will differ from child to child.

Parents and caregivers can encourage children to ask questions, challenge assumptions and explore different ways of seeing things. There are also programmes like Web Rangers that help children to develop these skills so they can become responsible digital citizens. Children who can think critically will gain the confidence to rely on their own reasoning rather than just unthinkingly adopting others’ attitudes. These skills will help them to make responsible choices. Spending time building a trusting relationship with your children is also crucial. Parenting for a digital future goes beyond the fear-driven response of regulating screen time and parental policing. Critical capacity is developed through negotiation and engagement. And of course these skills are universally applicable, protecting children in other aspects of their lives, too. Wakithi Mabaso receives funding from the Rhodes Trust.

        "article_text": "Steelworkers line up for their paychecks at U.S. Steel's South Works in Chicago in 1959. Bettman Collection via Getty Images It was midday on a Saturday, and Simonetta led me from the open front door of her home in southeast Chicago to her sitting room and settled next to her husband, Christopher, on the couch. In the 1980s, Christopher had worked a few blocks away at U.S. Steel South Works , earning three times the minimum wage with a high school diploma – more than enough to buy a house near Simonetta’s parents before their first baby arrived. Like their neighbors in southeast Chicago , Simonetta and Christopher’s expectations for work and home were set by the steel industry. Between 1875 and 1990, the employment offered here by eight steel mills created a dense network of working-class neighborhoods on the marshlands 15 miles south of downtown Chicago. For the tens of thousands of employees who lived and worked in this region, steel was a rare breed of work: unionized, blue-collar jobs that paid middle-class wages, with starting salaries in the 1960s at nearly three times the minimum wage . Opportunities for promotion, benefits and secure job tenure allowed workers to buy houses, shop at local stores and put away savings. The steel industry was more than just work ; it organized the spatial and social relations of this neighborhood. Homes and businesses on tree-lined streets spread out from the sites of former steel mills along the Calumet River. U.S. Steel South Works was on Lake Michigan, just north of the river. H. Michael Miley via Flickr , CC BY-SA Its collapse was devastating to people living in the neighborhood, Simonetta told me. As mill after mill shuttered in the last two decades of the 20th century, people began to leave to find new work – mostly service jobs – located far from southeast Chicago’s economic depression. As we stared at the silent street, I asked them, “Why did you stay?” Christopher paused, then said simply, “We had the building.” The couple owned their three-story row home outright after decades of paying off the mortgage. Sure, it had some crumbling corners and the roof sagged, but it was theirs. These four walls remained solid during and after the topsy-turvy years of economic collapse. More than just a form of equity or material space, this building was the foundation for their stability. Why do people stay in hard places? For the past 10 years, I’ve asked why people stay when their local economy collapses. In my 2024 book, “ Who We Are Is Where We Are: Making Home in the American Rust Belt ,” I used ethnographic research and interviews to study the long-term outcomes of deindustrialization in a rural iron-mining community in Wisconsin and urban manufacturing neighborhoods set amid the steel mills of Chicago. The causes of deindustrialization were macroeconomic and global – technological change, trade deals, environmental regulations and increased competition – but the effects were local. In the second half of the 20th century, towns and cities that grew up around industries that extracted iron and manufactured steel suddenly lost the core of their blue-collar employment. Steelworkers on strike at U.S. Steel’s South Works in 1952. During the industry’s heyday in Chicago, South Works employed more than 15,000 people at its complex on Lake Michigan’s shore. It closed in 1992. AP Photo/Ed Maloney Stretching from New York to Minnesota, the Rust Belt region has experienced five decades of nearly double-digit unemployment rates . In the wake of industrial closures, hundreds of thousands of unemployed people packed up their houses and sought their fortunes in factories or mines in the American South, or anywhere that wasn’t collapsing from economic depression. In the process, these deindustrialized places not only lost their grip on their residents but their place in the American story of economic progress, growth and resilience. But not everyone leaves. For this research, I talked with more than 100 people , like Simonetta and Christopher, to understand why people stay in these neighborhoods as jobs dry up and stores close. Again and again, they argued that their stuckness in place offered them stability in a chaotic world. Homeownership: A trap and a way to stay The people I spoke with often began their stories with a practical – and economic – concern: the finances and freedoms of homeownership. For many long-term residents, moving elsewhere was economically impossible. Depressed housing values meant they couldn’t recoup their investments by selling, and the process of moving is itself expensive. Yet they also argued that owning their house offered them a little piece of stability in the early years of unemployment. In the mid-20th century, good wages combined with federally backed home loans opened avenues of homeownership for blue-collar iron and steelworkers. In the 1950s, south Chicago’s business district, less than a mile from the mills, was thriving. Curt Teich Postcard Archives Digital Collection (Newberry Library) via Wikimedia Beginning in the 1960s, southeast Chicago transitioned from a majority rental community to one where between 60% and 70% of houses were owner-occupied . For Christopher, Simonetta and thousands of their neighbors, buying a home was a sound financial decision and a path toward achieving the American middle-class goal of building wealth through private property ownership. Of course, houses are more than simply material investments. Simonetta and Christopher’s house was also their family story. In the first half of the 20th century, Simonetta’s parents had immigrated from Mexico. Christopher’s grandparents had arrived from Mexico at the turn of the 20th century. Simonetta explained that since they had grown up in the neighborhood, when they got married, they wanted to buy a place within walking distance of their parents and webs of aunts, uncles and cousins. The mill neighborhoods’ proximity to Lake Michigan means fishing and beaches nearby. Calumet Beach, shown in 2021, saw racial conflicts in the early 1900s but became popular with the entire community by mid-century. Jamie Kelter Davis/For The Washington Post via Getty Images When they made the down payment in 1980, they benefited from plummeting house prices. Wisconsin Steel had just closed its nearby mill, and housing prices in nearby neighborhoods had already dropped by 9% . But they hadn’t expected the whole region’s housing bubble to pop. Housing prices in their neighborhood began to fall as U.S. Steel slowly laid off workers through the 1980s and 1990s. Even today, the median price of homes listed in southeast Chicago ranges from $80,000–100,000, less than a third of Chicago’s median of $330,000 . When the neighboring mill closed, their family networks were stuck. Simonetta recalled, “My father, my parents still lived in the neighborhood. They weren’t going anywhere. Where were they going to go?” She continued, “It’s not like we’re rich. I mean, the mill’s closed. We were unemployed!” People fish in the Calumet River, with the wall of the U.S. Steel South Works site behind them. The site has been considered for several revitalization efforts, most recently as a technology center for quantum computing. Amanda McMillan Lequieu , CC BY-ND Even if their parents wanted to sell their house and start a new life in a more promising location, selling in the economic free fall of deindustrialization would have cost them too much. Mass unemployment turned homes that were once sound financial investments into nearly unsellable liabilities. What is gained from staying at home? Even while the economics of homeownership limited options, owning property was also a haven when everything else was in turmoil. Having “the building,” as Christopher called their house, made their path forward simple: Put food on the table by doing odd jobs and commuting an hour-plus to the suburbs, and look out for each other. Home is also where family, socially constructed identities and familiar experiences coalesce. The people I spoke with drove me to their favorite lakes and parks, sketched maps to their beloved shops or hiking paths, and pointed out historical markers of industrial pasts. They celebrated the social networks that still anchored their identities in place – extended family, annual parades and regular school and work reunions. Wrapped In Steel: A 1984 documentary on the neighborhoods of southeast Chicago. Produced and Directed by James R Martin. Interviewees were quick to admit that the sprawling crisis of deindustrialization constrained choices and limited their options. But within the fractured scaffolding of postindustrial social life, a generation of long-term residents still belong to one another. “We survived, and that’s why we didn’t leave,” Simonetta said. “The community has changed, but where else are we going to go? I mean, we’ve been here for fifty-something years. … This is my neighborhood.” “That’s how you destroy neighborhoods,” Christopher interjected, “by leaving!” Amanda McMillan Lequieu does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.",

        "article_text": "In the 1920s, many women became more comfortable in their skin. But the facts of life remained in short supply. George Grantham Bain Collection/Library of Congress American women still have fewer orgasms than men , according to new research that suggests that decades after the sexual revolution, the “orgasm gap” is still very much in effect. One of the study’s lead authors at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction told The New York Times that the gap persists because many Americans continue to “prioritize men’s pleasure and undervalue women’s sexual pleasure.” As my research shows , these attitudes toward sexual pleasure have a long history. But so do efforts to push back against them. Almost a century ago, a pioneering American sex researcher named Katharine Bement Davis challenged the prevailing view that respectable women did not – and should not – experience sexual desire or have sex, except to please men or to have children. Davis’s 1929 book, “ Factors in the Sex Life of Twenty-Two Hundred Women ,” completely upended this thinking. By surveying everyday American women, she was able to show that it was completely normal for American women to have sex for the sake of pleasure. An unlikely advocate for sexual liberation Davis spent the first half of her career policing women’s sexuality, not promoting it. In 1901, after earning her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, Davis became superintendent of the New York State Reformatory for Women at Bedford Hills . While there, she studied the women in her care. Most female convicts, she concluded, were “immoral women.” Davis’ efforts to enforce sexual morality drew the attention of philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. In 1917, he invited her to lead his private agency, the Bureau of Social Hygiene , founded to study and combat prostitution and venereal disease. During World War I, Davis promoted sex education to curb sexually transmitted infections among soldiers and civilians. Through this work, she became convinced that sexual ignorance – not sexual immorality – posed the greatest danger to women’s welfare. Davis had long criticized the sexual double standard , which condoned men’s sexual experimentation but condemned women’s sexual experience. Now, she also recognized that this double standard promoted women’s chastity at the expense of knowledge. She complained that discussions of women’s sexuality were “taboo,” which resulted in “distorted views, baffled speculation, and unfortunate experiences.” Tackling a taboo topic Insisting that Americans needed accurate information to achieve “a sane outlook on all matters pertaining to sex,” Davis made it her mission to teach women about sex. But first, she needed to learn about women’s actual sexual experiences. Davis decided to undertake a large-scale study of what she called “the sex life of normal women.” Davis’ approach was a dramatic departure from existing studies of “abnormal” sexuality focused on institutionalized populations. “Except on the pathological side,” she remarked , “sex is scientifically an unexplored country.” Katharine Bement Davis was frustrated by the double standard that celebrated men’s sexual experiences and condemned those of women. Heritage Art/Heritage Images via Getty Images By contrast, Davis explained , she wanted to understand “the woman who was not pathological mentally or physically.” To that end, Davis distributed a detailed questionnaire to what she called “women of good standing in the community” from 1921 to 1923. The resulting study sample of 1,000 married women and 1,200 unmarried women was not representative – it skewed white, well-educated and well-to-do. But their responses allowed Davis to redefine female sexuality. America’s first sexual revolution Davis launched her study of women’s sexuality during what historians now refer to as America’s first sexual revolution . The second – and more well-known one – would take place in the 1960s . In the 1920s, as one commentator noted , a “revolution in manners and morals” was underway. Sex suffused popular culture. Contestants in beauty pageants displayed their charms in skimpy bathing costumes and short skirts.  Actresses flaunted their sex appeal on stage and screen. New attitudes about sex affected the daily lives of average Americans, too. Young women throughout the nation adopted the sexy look of “ flappers ,” the term used for women who sported short skirts, rolled stockings and bobbed hair. Prior to the 1920s, courtship often took place in the home, allowing parents to closely supervise couples. But the ubiquitous automobile – which one juvenile court judge had dubbed “a house of prostitution on wheels” – rendered adult chaperonage obsolete and granted young people unprecedented sexual freedom. Meanwhile, birth control activists like Margaret Sanger and Mary Ware Dennett distributed contraceptive devices and disseminated sexual information in defiance of the Comstock Act of 1873 , which had defined birth control and sex education as “obscene” and made circulating such materials a federal crime. Sex, secrecy and shame Even amid the nation’s first sexual revolution, the facts of life remained in short supply. According to surveys Davis distributed to married women, only about half of the respondents believed that they had been “adequately prepared … for the sex side of marriage.” After expanding her study to include unmarried women, Davis found that fewer than one-third of all participants received sex education from their parents. Many women didn’t know how pregnancy occurred. Some had been unprepared even for menstruation. One recalled that when she experienced her first period, “I naturally thought I was bleeding to death.” In place of information, many women imbibed shame. “Having acquired the feeling as a small child that any sex pleasure was shameful and a great sin,” as one respondent put it , some could never overcome their discomfort with sex. Another woman regarded all sexual thoughts as “something to be shunned like the devil.” One response succinctly summarized the problem : “Our present secrecy, fear, and repression are responsible for most of our sex ills.” Challenging the conspiracy of silence Many women were eager to challenge what one called a “conspiracy of silence” surrounding female sexuality. Study participants ended up providing Davis with over 10,000 pages of handwritten responses. She used this information to produce the nation’s first major study of women’s sexuality , a 400-plus page book brimming with both statistical data and personal stories. “ Factors in the Sex Life of Twenty-Two Hundred Women ” covered a wide range of topics, ranging from sex education to sex play. Running throughout the entire work, however, was one central idea: Women liked sex. Davis included data on birth control, same-sex relationships and masturbation. At the time, these practices were universally stigmatized and often criminalized. Yet significant proportions of study participants engaged in all these activities. Nearly three-quarters of married respondents reported using contraceptives. Many probably took advantage of state laws allowing physicians to prescribe diaphragms to protect patients’ health. Surprisingly, nearly 1 in 10 women admitted having abortions, even though the procedure was illegal in every state. More than half of unmarried women and nearly one-third of married women stated that they had experienced “ intense emotional relationships ” with other women. In each group, approximately half described those relationships as sexual. This was a remarkably high figure, given prevailing views of homosexuality as sexual deviance and state laws criminalizing homosexual acts . Nearly 65% of unmarried women and more than 40% of married women reported masturbating . Since nearly all physicians and pastors condemned the practice , Davis assumed the actual numbers were even higher. Davis’ data demonstrated that “normal” women experienced what one called “natural sex feeling.” In short, her study showed that many women enjoyed sex for its own sake. Davis believed that reliable data would lead to “more satisfactory adjustments of the sex relationship.” In other words, better information would lead to better sex. Davis paved the way for future studies that validate women’s sexual pleasure. While researching female sexuality, she established the National Research Council’s Committee for Research on the Problems of Sex . The Rockefeller-funded committee later subsidized Alfred Kinsey’s studies of human sexuality. Davis’ legacy lives on. The findings from the Kinsey Institute’s latest study show that discussing sexual pleasure still matters, particularly for women. It also suggests that Americans’ understandings of sex have improved over the past century. When Davis conducted her study in the 1920s, she found it “advisable” to define “orgasm” for participants who were unclear on the concept. Now, a generation of better-informed Americans ponder how to address a persistent “orgasm gap.” Anya Jabour does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.",

        "article_text": "Ohio National Guard soldiers move in on war protesters at Kent State University on May 4, 1970. AP Photo Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has expressed his intention, if elected to a second term, to use the U.S. armed forces to suppress domestic protests . The New York Times reports that Trump’s allies are marshaling legal arguments to justify using National Guard or active-duty military troops for crowd control . Moreover, as the Times notes, Trump has asserted that if he returns to the White House, he will dispatch such forces without waiting for state or local officials to request such assistance . I am a historian who has written several books about the Vietnam War, one of the most divisive episodes in our nation’s past. My new book, “ Kent State: An American Tragedy ,” examines a historic clash on May 4, 1970 , between anti-war protesters and National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio. The confrontation escalated into violence: Troops opened fire on the demonstrators, killing four students and wounding nine others, including one who was paralyzed for life. In my view, the prospect of dispatching troops in the way that Trump proposes chillingly echoes actions that led up to the Kent State shootings. Some active-duty units , as well as National Guard troops , are trained today to respond to riots and violent protests – but their primary mission is still to fight, kill, and win wars. Archival footage from CBS News of the clash between campus anti-war protesters and Ohio National Guard troops at Kent State University on May 4, 1970. Federalizing the Guard The National Guard is a force of state militias under the command of governors. It can be federalized by the president during times of national emergency or for deployment on combat missions overseas. Guardsmen train for one weekend per month and two weeks every summer. Typically, the Guard has been deployed to deal with natural disasters and support local police responses to urban unrest , such as riots in Detroit in 1967 , Washington in 1968 , Los Angeles in 1965 and 1992 , and Minneapolis and other cities in 2020 after the death of George Floyd. The 1807 Insurrection Act grants presidents authority to use active-duty troops or National Guard forces to restore order within the United States. However, presidents rarely deploy Guard troops without state governors’ consent. The main modern exceptions occurred during the Civil Rights Movement, when Southern governors resisted federal orders to desegregate schools in Arkansas , Mississippi and Alabama . In each case, the troops were sent to protect Black students from crowds of white protesters. The standoff at Kent State The war in Vietnam had grown increasingly unpopular by early 1970, but protests intensified on April 30 when President Richard Nixon authorized expanding the conflict into Cambodia . At Kent State, after a noontime anti-war rally on campus on May 1, alcohol-fueled students harassed passing motorists in town and smashed storefront windows that night. On May 2, anti-war protesters set fire to the building where military officers trained Kent State students enrolled in the armed forces’ Reserve Officer Training Corps program. In response, Republican Gov. Jim Rhodes dispatched National Guard troops, against the advice of university and many local officials, who understood the mood in the town of Kent and on campus far better than Rhodes did. County prosecutor Ron Kane had vehemently warned Rhodes that deploying the National Guard could spark conflict and lead to fatalities. Nonetheless, Rhodes – who was trailing in an impending Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat – struck the pose of a take-charge leader who wasn’t going to be pushed around by a long-haired rabble. “We’re going to put a stop to this!” he shouted, pounding the table at a press conference in Kent on May 3. Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed across town and on campus. University officials announced that further rallies were banned . Nonetheless, on May 4, some 2,000 to 3,000 students gathered on the campus Commons for another anti-war rally. They were met by 96 National Guardsmen, led by eight officers. There was an edge of confrontation in the air as student anger over Nixon’s expansion of the war blended with resentment over the Guard’s presence. Protesters chanted antiwar slogans, shouted epithets at the Guardsmen and made obscene gestures. Doug Guthrie, a student at Kent State in 1970, looks back 54 years later at the events of May 4. ‘Fire in the air!’ The Guardsmen sent to Kent State had no training in de-escalating tension or minimizing the use of force. Nonetheless, their commanding officer that day, Ohio Army National Guard Assistant Adjutant General Robert Canterbury, decided to use them to break up what the Department of Justice later deemed a legal assembly . In my view, it was a reckless judgment that inflamed an already volatile situation. Students started showering the greatly outnumbered Guardsmen with rocks and other objects. In violation of Ohio Army National Guard regulations, Canterbury neglected to warn the students that the Guardsmens’ rifles were loaded with live ammunition. As tension mounted, Canterbury failed to adequately supervise his increasingly fearful troops – a cardinal responsibility of the commanding officer on the scene. This fundamental failure of leadership increased confusion and resulted in a breakdown of fire control discipline – officers’ responsibility to maintain tight control over their troops’ discharge of weapons. When protesters neared the Guardsmen, platoon sergeant Mathew McManus shouted “Fire in the air!” in a desperate attempt to prevent bloodshed. McManus intended for troops to shoot above the students’ heads to warn them off. But some Guardsmen, wearing gas masks that made it hard to hear amid the noise and confusion, only heard or reacted to the first word of McManus’ order, and fired at the students. The troops had not been trained to fire warning shots, which was contrary to National Guard regulations. And McManus had no authority to issue an order to fire if officers were nearby, as they were. Many National Guardsmen who were at Kent State on May 4 later questioned why they had been deployed there. “Loaded rifles and fixed bayonets are pretty harsh solutions for students exercising free speech on an American campus,” one of them told an oral history interviewer . Another plaintively asked me in a 2023 interview, “Why would you put soldiers trained to kill on a university campus to serve a police function?” A fighting force National Guard equipment and training have improved significantly in the decades since Kent State. But Guardsmen are still troops who are fundamentally trained to fight, not to control crowds. In 2020, then-National Guard Bureau Chief General Joseph Lengyel told reporters that “the civil unrest mission is one of the most difficult and dangerous missions … in our domestic portfolio.” In my view, the tragedy of Kent State shows how critical it is for authorities to be thoughtful in responding to protests, and extremely cautious in deploying military troops to deal with them. Force is inherently unpredictable, often uncontrollable, and can lead to fatal mistakes and lasting human suffering. And while protests sometimes break rules, they may not be disruptive or harmful enough to merit responding with force. Aggressive displays of force often heighten tensions and worsen situations. Conversely, research shows that if protesters perceive authorities are behaving with restraint and treating them with respect, they are more likely to remain nonviolent . The shooting at Kent State demonstrates why force should be an absolute last resort in dealing with protests – and one fraught with grave risks.

Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Over the past four years, Congress and state governments have worked hard to prevent the aftermath of the 2024 election from descending into the chaos and threats to democracy that occurred around the 2020 U.S. presidential election. A new federal law cleaned up ambiguities that could allow for election subversion . New state laws have been enacted across the country to protect election workers from threats and harassment. Technology experts are working to confront misinformation campaigns and vulnerabilities in election systems. But untouched in all of these improvements is the underlying structure of presidential elections – the Electoral College . Here is a quick refresher about how the system works today: After citizens vote in the presidential election in November, the Constitution assigns the task of choosing the president and vice president to electors . Electors are allocated based on the number of congressional representatives and senators from each state. The electors meet in their separate state capitals in December to cast their votes. The ballots are then counted by the vice president in front of members of Congress on Jan. 6 to determine which ticket has won a majority. The widely varied pros and cons of the Electoral College have already been aired and debated extensively. But there is another problem that few have recognized: The Electoral College makes American democracy more vulnerable to people with malicious intent. A state-centric system The original brilliance of the Electoral College has become one of its prime weaknesses. The unusual system was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 as a compromise that prioritized the representation of state interests . This focus helped win over reluctant delegates who feared that the most populous states would disregard small states’ concerns. Nowadays nearly every state has chosen to award all of its electoral votes to whichever ticket wins more votes in the state. Even if a candidate gets 51% of the popular vote, use of the winner-take-all rule in these states means they will be awarded 100% of the electoral votes. This is what leads to the “battleground state” phenomenon: Presidential candidates focus their rallies, advertisements and outreach efforts on the few states where campaigns could actually tip the balance. In 2020, 77% of all campaign ads ran in just six states that were home to only 21% of the nation’s population. In this way, the Electoral College system naturally draws campaign attention to issues that might tip the balance in these hotbeds of competitiveness. Electors from Wisconsin cast their presidential ballots on Dec. 15, 2020. Morry Gash-Pool/Getty Images A road map for bad behavior By doing so, the system essentially identifies the states where malicious people who want to alter or undermine the election results should focus their energies. The handful of battleground states are efficient targets for harmful efforts that would otherwise not have much success meddling in elections. Someone who wants to infiltrate the election system would have difficulty causing problems in a national popular vote because it is decided by thousands of disconnected local jurisdictions . In contrast, the Electoral College makes it convenient to sow mischief by only meddling in a few states widely seen as decisive. In 2020, the lawsuits, hacking, alternative electors, recount efforts and other challenges did not target states perceived by some to have weaker security because they had less strict voter ID laws or voter signature requirements. Opponents of the results also did not go after states such as California and Texas that account for a large share of the country’s voters. Rather, all of the firepower was trained on about a half-dozen swing states. By one account, there were 82 lawsuits filed in the days after the 2020 presidential election , 77 of which targeted six swing states. The “fake elector” schemes in which supporters of Donald Trump put forward unofficial lists of electors occurred in only seven battleground states. The popular vote alternative A majority of Americans say in surveys they prefer to scrap the Electoral College system and simply award the presidency to the person who gets the most votes nationwide. Dumping the Electoral College would have a variety of consequences, but it would immediately remove opportunities for disrupting elections via battleground states. A close election in Arizona or Pennsylvania would no longer provide leverage for upending the national result. Any election system that does not rely on states as the puzzle pieces for deciding elections would remove opportunities like these. It could also seriously reduce disputes over recounts and suspicion about late-night ballot counts, long lines and malfunctioning voting machines because those local concerns would be swamped by the national vote totals. Although not without its own concerns , an agreement among the states to award their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote is probably the most viable method for shifting to the popular vote, in part because it does not require passing an amendment to the Constitution . There is no ideal way to run a presidential election. The Electoral College has survived in its current form for almost two centuries, a remarkable run for democracy. But in an era where intense scrutiny of just a few states is the norm, the system also lights the way for those who would harm democracy. Barry C.

Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images Anita Diamant, the prolific writer and Jewish feminist activist , begins her book “ The Jewish Wedding Now ” with a simple statement: “According to Jewish law, the requirements for a kosher wedding can be summed up in a few words: a bride accepts an object worth more than a dime from a groom; the groom recites a ritual formula to consecrate the transaction; the actions are witnessed by two people who are not related to either bride or groom. That’s it.” But actual Jewish weddings are much more than that: They have before, during and after phases, and they vary widely throughout the world. To explore Jewish women’s experiences of their weddings, my new book, “ 100 Jewish Brides ,” co-edited with fellow sociologist Barbara Vinick , offers accounts written by Jewish brides – or their relatives, friends or clergy – from almost 100 different countries. The writers typically begin with experiences that occurred long before the wedding, especially how, when and where they met the person whom they would marry. Many Jews believe that one person exists on Earth who is destined to be their partner, their “beshert.” Brides also have heard wedding narratives from an early age, which they are eager to fulfill. An especially prominent theme in the brides’ stories is pre-wedding practices, both religious and secular. Cantor Rachelle Nelson officiates during a Jewish wedding ceremony in 2021 for Gene Yaffee and Faye Albert at The Palace Coral Gables, a senior living residence in Florida. AP Photo/Lynne Sladky The mikvah party Religious Jews prepare their weddings around halachic regulations – that is, Jewish law. These may include practicing “shomer negiyah ” – not touching each other at all, from the moment the couple meet until they stand under the chuppah, or wedding canopy. The couple may also fast on the day of the wedding. Sir Jonathan Sacks, the late chief rabbi of the United Kingdom , encouraged couples to use part of the pre-wedding period to draft a prenuptial agreement to prevent future problems around divorce . The pre-wedding obligation of mikvah, or mikveh – when the naked bride fully immerses in a pool of flowing water – is essential for observant Jews and is becoming attractive to non-Orthodox Jews , as the mikvah pool has modernized. In Jewish history, immersing is so important that a Jewish community must create a mikvah before building any other structure. The bride’s immersion before marriage has several meanings. The meticulous cleaning of her body symbolizes purifying herself for marriage and sexual intimacy and coming closer to God. For some Jewish women, the premarital immersion may also mark the start of her monthly immersion in coordination with her menstrual cycle. Inside a mikvah in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, N.Y. Mk17b via Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA In our book , women from Greece, Israel, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Yemen described their mikvah ceremony as both a solemn spiritual experience and a group celebration. “ Leona,” a charming Mexican film , opens with a long segment in which the soon-to-be-married bride swims underwater while her female friends and relatives sit around the pool laughing and singing. The mikvah party binds the entire group and passes the tradition on to the future brides. Zanet Battinou, from Greece, wrote about having her mikvah in the sea as her mother, mother-in-law, grandmother and friends sat on the beach. “My friends brought sweets to nibble on, and my mom-in-law prepared the traditional basket of luxurious towels, perfume, and bathroom goodies that every bride receives,” she recalled. “I have kept the lovely towels for my daughter to use someday, please God. My mikveh was full of love, meaning and reverence. I will never forget it.” The henna party A woman prepares to apply henna to women’s hands at a celebration in Israel for a Yemeni Jewish couple. Courtesy of Barbara Vinick A second pre-wedding theme in the brides’ stories was the secular henna party, where guests and professionals apply temporary dye from the henna plant to the bride or the bridal couple – and sometimes to the guests – to create intricate designs on their hands and feet. Similar traditions are common throughout many North African, Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures, across religions. Among Jews, henna parties are popular among Mizrahi and Sephardi families – those with roots in the Middle East and North Africa. Rachel Jacobson sent us a story about her relative’s henna party for 500 people in Marrakech, Morocco. “The women wore gorgeous caftans and many of them changed garments four or five times during the event,” she recalled. Both bride and groom entered the room on thrones carried by four men, as singers performed in French, Arabic and Hebrew. The couple was showered with jewelry, which covered the bride in gold and diamonds. Then a family member applied henna to all the palms of all the guests – men and women – who wanted it followed by nonstop eating and entertainment until morning.“ A bride and groom in Morocco enter their henna party, a treasured pre-wedding tradition for some Sephardi Jews. Courtesy of Barbara Vinick Intermarriage and conversion \"Jewish Intermarriage around the World,” a 2009 book I co-edited with demographer Sergio DellaPergola , examined data from 13 countries. One hundred years ago, most Jews lived in places where the rate of intermarriage was lower than 5%. Today, however, most Jews outside Israel live in countries where at least 1 in 3 Jewish people marry a non-Jew. As intermarriage became common, new rituals are created. Some ceremonies may use the services of both a rabbi and an officiant of another religion. In some cases, the non-Jewish partner wishes to convert, either before or after the wedding. This topic can create hurtful or welcoming pre-wedding plans, depending on the families’ commitment to the other religion and previous history with intermarriage. Gabriela Fraenkel, a bride from Uruguay, wrote about her intermarriage . When she met her future husband, Santiago, it was “love at first sight.” “Santi,” his nickname, “was Christian but not a believer,” Gabriela wrote. “After a while, he began to come with me to synagogue and Jewish holiday celebrations. … A few months later, Santi told me that he wanted to convert.” In Gabriela’s community, conversion required a year of study with a rabbi – and, for men, a symbolic circumcision, or “brit milah.” Their unplanned course of action – to wait a few years before marrying – may not suit most people, but it became a critical component for this couple that preserved “shalom bayit,” which can be translated from Hebrew as “domestic tranquility.” Women in Madagascar wait to submerge in a river, used as a mikvah, before a conversion to Judaism. Some of the women were also about to be married. Courtesy of Barbara Vinick A community is strengthened What happens before a Jewish wedding depends on how the couple define their Jewish identities, if at all. It depends on where the couple lives and on the families’ resources. And it depends on traditions the couple chooses to include or exclude. Despite these multiple roots, the shared outcome is the same: a strengthening of the Jewish community, a striking theme that permeates these stories. People come together and celebrate the couple and the institution of marriage. They are encouraged to comment on the bride’s beauty and to dance with unbridled joy. Even COVID-19 could not stop weddings. They simply changed from in-person to on Zoom . Jewish weddings are more than reenactments of the past. Rather, they acknowledge the present and adapt to many different demands. When the actual ceremony is done, everyone present breathes a sigh of relief as the couple stamp on a glass, crushing it to the collective cry: Le'Chayim! To Life!

        "article_text": "Many commentators believe that the world should move away from measuring economic success in terms of GDP growth. Yes, growth has brought prosperity and untold riches, but it has had significant negative side effects for the planet, including climate change, pollution and species extinction. None of these are captured in GDP data. A whole “beyond GDP” movement has emerged over the last several decades, arguing that we should adopt a new way of measuring the wealth of nations. There is an ongoing debate about the best alternative, and many indicators have supporters, such as gross national happiness and the genuine progress indicator . Yet one stands out as having by far the most buy-in from major international institutions. Known as “inclusive wealth”, it expands what we mean by wealth to include things like the natural environment and the abilities of the population. But it comes with a major problem. There’s no agreement around how it should be measured, so different institutions publish very different figures. In our view, this is a major obstacle to its mass adoption. Inclusive wealth Inclusive wealth ascribes a value to the assets a nation has produced that generate well-being, and measures how they are changing over time. These assets are: Human capital: the knowledge and skills of the population. Produced capital: goods and services produced by human endeavour. Natural capital: the sum of all nature-based assets from which humans derive well-being, both now and in the future. Social capital: the social networks that exist within a society. There is strong theoretical support for the idea that this approach is a good way of measuring the sustainability of economic development . The key point is that when inclusive wealth per capita is going up, the future wellbeing of the population will go up, which is a necessary condition for sustainable development. Foundational texts in support of inclusive wealth include Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta’s 2001 book , Human Well-Being and the Environment, and his Harvard counterpart Martin Weitzman’s 2003 book , Income, Wealth and the Maximum Principle. Dasgupta carried out a review for the UK government in 2021 into the economics of biodiversity, which similarly advocates for measuring national inclusive wealth instead of national income. There have also been recent calls by academics in this field to use inclusive wealth to help with the global biodiversity framework , a UN-led drive to be “living in harmony with nature” by 2050. Inclusive wealth is measured by both the World Bank and UN Environment Programme (Unep) . The World Bank has been measuring it since the late 1990s, and first published global estimates in a 2006 report called Where is the wealth of nations : measuring capital for the 21st century. It has since published three major updates to this report, including a major revision to the methodology, with another on the way. As for Unep, it began measuring inclusive wealth in 2012 . But there are still some kinks that need ironing out before this indicator can be of any practical use. In a new paper in Ecological Economics , we compare the approaches of the World Bank and Unep and find a big divergence in their calculations. This may explain why inclusive wealth has yet to be adopted in any serious way by any major economies (all we’ve seen so far is some mentions in policy documents, like this one from New Zealand, and a recent decision by the Biden-Harris administration to start tracking the value of US natural resources at federal level using natural-capital accounting). The discrepancies relate mainly to natural capital. Both Unep and the World Bank include similar if not identical data from the same components: non-renewables such as fossil fuels and minerals, and renewable elements such as fisheries and forest resources. The problem is that the institutions’ research teams value them differently. The World Bank approach comes up with a present value for expected future earnings by discounting from what they will eventually be worth. In contrast, Unep uses fixed accounting prices, referred to as “shadow prices”, which are based on market prices today. This leads to different conclusions about the trajectory of our natural capital, and thus, by implication, of the sustainability of current development paths. This is then exacerbated by another discrepancy around how the institutions measure changes in human capital. Country differences In our paper, we highlight the case of Qatar. According to Unep, it is one of the worst performers in terms of the change in inclusive wealth per capita, and so is judged unsustainable. Yet according to World Bank estimates, Qatar’s inclusive wealth per capita is growing positively. Which is it? If development is unsustainable, some remedial action will be necessary, but if it is sustainable, no problem. How is the Qatari government to decide how to proceed? We find similar conflicting signals for many other countries. According to the World Bank data, 20 countries’ inclusive wealth per capita is in decline (in other words, unsustainable), while the Unep data has 45 countries in decline. There is also little crossover in terms of these two lists. As many as 34 of the countries that the World Bank says have growing inclusive wealth per capita are in decline according to Unep. We agree strongly with the basic proposition that measuring inclusive wealth is key to ensuring the world develops sustainably. But there needs to be a more consistent approach for this signal to achieve enough credibility to be widely adopted. In our experience, the World Bank is much more transparent than Unep about the data in its calculations. Without full Unep transparency, it’s difficult to get to the root of the discrepancy. Having said that, both broad approaches have merits, so it’s more a question of everyone committing to a single approach than arguing that one is better than the other. Unless this measurement problem can be resolved, it’s difficult to see countries taking inclusive wealth seriously. That could have serious consequences in the battle to make economic development sustainable.

Synonymous with luxury, sturgeon caviar has been patented as an antidote to impotency in China. Rhino horn is used in traditional Asian medicine to treat various ailments, and is also an ingredient in 50 different recipes for snuff. Similarly, pangolin scales have been suggested as an ingredient in livestock feed, according to a 2014 patent. Wildlife products, even those that have been traded and used for centuries, are the subject of constant innovation, and that could be putting rare and endangered animals under increasing pressure. Market shifts are usually detected after trade – either legal or illegal – has become established. Since 2014, jaguar parts began replacing the more rare and difficult to obtain tiger parts in Chinese markets . As businesses make technological advances, they apply for patents to protect their commercial interest. These patent applications document changes in species, products and locations of wildlife trade. So patents can provide a window into innovations related to wild products . In our new research, published in the journal Nature Communications , we analysed the patents for products sourced from various species. We selected bears, Ophiocordyceps caterpillar fungus, rhinos, pangolins, sturgeon and horseshoe crabs, to cover a range of use types, taxonomic groups and trade legalities. Using machine learning, we analysed half a century of wildlife-related patenting, looking at patents from 1970-2020. Pangolins cannot be traded legally but they are still killed for their scales. CameraBaba/Shutterstock We used a method called “changepoint analysis” to look for the key point at which patent filing rate changed, and also “topic modelling”, which grouped together patents with similar topics (such as medicine, food or farming) based on a set of keywords. We could then pinpoint key moments when patent filing rates shifted and explore when or how commercial interest changed. We found 27,308 patent applications for the species we focused on in this study. Patent filing rates for them increased at 130% per year since 1988, more than the average of 104% for all patent filing. On a global scale businesses consider wild species an important component of future commercial trade. While we expected that legislative bans would reduce patenting rates for products using wild species, and potentially increase patent filing for alternatives, this was not the case. Changes in patent filing trends did not always coincide with regulations such as trade bans. Patents filed for illegal products also increased. For example, 426 patents for medicines containing rhino horn were filed in China after it was banned as a medicinal ingredient there. This included a proposed treatment for blood disease in 2016 and an anti-cancer food supplement in 2013. This may suggest that, in most cases, businesses have some confidence that these markets will reopen in the future. It could also indicate that the people filing patents are unaware of these regulations. One exception was a decrease patent applications for products containing pangolins and an increase in patenet applications for patents related to farming patents, for example formula for feeding young pangolins, in 2017. This was the year when pangolins were legally protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in the equivalent of an international commercial trade ban. Innovative applications Patents diversified over time. This included the emergence of applications for horseshoe crab blood in the electronics industry in the 1980s, and a new “environmentally-friendly” pesticide containing rhino horn, which was patented in 2013. A Cordyceps caterpillar is preserved in whisky for medicinal use. Susanne Masters , CC BY-NC-ND Sometimes existing products are promoted for a new purpose. Cordyceps , a caterpillar controlled by an infecting fungus collected in the high altitude Himalayas, was a popular traditional medicine and food supplement. Demand for these products soared after they were named as a performance enhancer for athletes at the Beijing Olympics. The medicinal use of pangolin scales was the basis for a 2019 patent for healthcare trousers, which have a pouch containing pangolin scales and other medicinal ingredients. Innovations aimed at expanding markets and increasing profits for businesses can lead to more wild harvest and trade of animals, plants and fungi to meet demand. However, innovation can also focus on reducing wild trade through improved farming as an alternative to wild collecting. For example, there are patents for sturgeon breeding enclosures. Patents also include processes to produce synthetic versions of active ingredients, such as a bear bile substitute made from poultry bile in a lab. Wildlife trade is subject to the same pressures and processes as other commercial sectors. Understanding how and why businesses innovate is key to understanding the future of wildlife markets. Even illegal trade is not based solely in hidden markets. Patents reveal a side of wildlife trade that has not been recognised or incorporated into decision making. Conducting regular scans of patent applications could provide researchers with early warnings of emerging commercial interests that may lead to unsustainable or illegal harvesting. Policymakers and conservationists should use patent data to inform development of regulations and laws to identify businesses with a commercial interest in wildlife and better understand why and how they plan to use wild species. Companies working to reduce the impact of their global supply chains on biodiversity may need to consider the potentially hidden uses of wild species in fertilisers and pesticides. They must also examine ingredients such as squalene, an oil extracted from shark livers for use in sunscreen , cosmetics and personal care products. Unexpected use of wild species in widely available products increases the burden on consumers mindful of their impact on natural resources. Labelling requirements conceal wildlife used upstream of product manufacture. For example, wild-collected wrasse are sometimes used to control lice in farmed salmon pens but this isn’t mentioned on any product labels. The more information that is available on hidden wild harvests, the greater the opportunity there is to reduce pressure on wild species.

We could then pinpoint key moments when patent filing rates shifted and explore when or how commercial interest changed. One exception was a decrease patent applications for products containing pangolins and an increase in patenet applications for patents related to farming patents, for example formula for feeding young pangolins, in 2017.",

        "article_text": "Sk Hasan Ali / Shutterstock The current political turmoil in Bangladesh, which has seen the government collapse in the face of widespread protests, will pose a fresh set of challenges for the country’s economy. One of the most immediate impacts will be a slowdown in economic growth, as instability creates uncertainty and undermines investor confidence . According to government statistics, the country’s average annual growth in GDP over the past decade has been around 6.6%. Moody’s ratings agency predicts that this growth will fall well below 6% for the year ending June 2025. The interim government, which is led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, must facilitate political stability and restore law and order to put the country’s economy back on track. Read more: Bangladesh at a crossroad after Hasina's resignation – here's what could happen next Bangladesh was already facing a series of economic challenges before the recent bout of unrest. These have included a prolonged phase of high inflationary pressure since 2022. The rate of inflation reached a 12-year high of 11.66% in July, with food inflation spiking at a record 14.1%. This situation is set to continue. The restrictions on movement that were imposed during the unrest, as well as the disorder itself, disrupted supply chains and has led to shortages. There is no doubt that high inflationary pressure disproportionately affects low-income households. Supply chains in Bangladesh ground to a halt during the protests. Tanjil.Rahman / Shutterstock Slow growth in job creation and unemployment, especially among educated youths , has also long been an issue in Bangladesh. Around 40% of Bangladeshi citizens aged 15 to 24 are currently classified as not in education, employment or training, which is almost double the global average. Private sector investment in the country, which is a major creator of jobs, has been stagnant for much of the past decade. And the ongoing turmoil will deliver the investment landscape another blow. At the same time, Bangladesh’s macroeconomic situation has been on shaky ground for a while. Its reserves of foreign exchange have declined drastically, from US$48 billion (£36.6 billion) in August 2021 to just over US$18 billion (£13.8 billion) in May 2024. The current level of reserves barely meets the minimum benchmark set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for countries to clear import payments. A prolonged period of instability could cause a further deterioration , as export and remittance earnings slow . These are the two major drivers of growth in Bangladesh, having been responsible for two-thirds of the overall growth in GDP per capita between 2001 and 2020. Restoring the economy The interim government’s main focus will be to lay the groundwork for an orderly transition to more permanent leadership. But it will also be expected to address the country’s pressing economic challenges. The immediate task is to tackle inflation. Economists in Bangladesh and the IMF have accused the central bank of failing to use monetary policy properly in recent years. For instance, interest rates were capped at 9% for lending and 6% for bank deposits between April 2020 and June 2023, despite growing inflationary pressure. The government, which had been led by Sheikh Hasina since 2009, also borrowed heavily from the central bank in an attempt to address its dismal performance in mobilising revenue. However, borrowing from the central bank usually stokes inflationary pressure as it puts more money into circulation. A new governor of the central bank, eminent economist Ahsan H. Mansur, has taken over and expectations are high about the bank fulfilling its due roles. But many of the challenges facing Bangladesh’s economy are structural. In the banking sector , for example, reforms are needed to address issues such as very high default rates on loans, poor governance and inadequate risk management practices. Data from the Bangladesh Bank shows that approximately 11% of loans are subject to late repayment or are not repaid at all – with the actual amount likely to be twice as high . There needs to be better transparency and more regulatory oversight to ensure that banks adopt sound financial practices . The interim government has announced that it will soon form a banking commission to address these issues. Tax revenue collection in Bangladesh is also much lower than it is in other countries with a similar level of development. The new government will need to broaden the tax base , improve tax compliance, and enhance the efficiency of tax collection. These reforms should allow public expenditure to increase. Public spending in Bangladesh has been considerably lower than similar countries over recent years, at around 15% of GDP . This has, in part, been the result of widespread corruption. During Hasina’s 15 years in power, nearly US$150 billion (£115 billion) was siphoned out of the country . US-based thinktank Global Financial Integrity, found that most of the stolen funds came from loans taken from banks, largely by politically influential people and businesses. Hasina’s government faced numerous allegations of corruption. Sk Hasan Ali / Shutterstock And finally, Bangladesh needs to move away from its current reliance on its garment industry. Ready-made garments are by far the biggest export industry in the country, accounting for 85% of all export revenues. But diversifying the export base will be no easy feat. Bangladesh is scheduled to graduate from the UN’s least developed countries list in 2026. As a result, the country will probably no longer benefit from the trade preferences it currently receives in many countries, such as zero duties on its exports. On top of this, the country attracts very little inward foreign investment. To make Bangladeshi businesses a more attractive proposition for investors, the new government must take steps towards liberalising trade, relaxing investment regulations and removing structural barriers like access to finance. But, ultimately, Bangladesh needs a stable government. This will require all political parties and representatives in the country to rally around a reformist agenda.

        "article_text": "Liam and Noel Gallagher have finally announced an Oasis reunion tour, 15 years after they disbanded due to their constant feuds. Definitely Maybe, the album that launched the band, celebrates its 30th birthday on August 29. Branded one of the greatest debut albums of all time by many music critics, what is it that makes it so good? I think it comes down to five core components – relatability, positivity, keeping it simple, catchy lyrics and the perfect frontman. 1. Relatability Described by Noel as “an honest snapshot of working-class lads trying to make it” , Definitely Maybe involved no guitar effects and barely any equipment , but made up for it with loads of attitude, “12 cans of Red Stripe and ambition” . Oasis looked like five ordinary blokes who had been dragged out of the local pub and shoved on stage. And that was a big part of their initial appeal. It felt like if they could make it, then we all had a chance. This appeal was further enhanced when fans realised that the drum parts could be learned by anyone with the most rudimentary drum skills (Live Forever and Supersonic were my favourites to bash out on the battered old school drumkit). And, although Noel’s description of his guitar-playing abilities as “average at fucking best” is a little disingenuous, for those who purchased the Definitely Maybe guitar tab book, his parts were eminently playable. 2. Positivity Definitely Maybe is a definitive statement of working-class values and anti-establishment ideals . But the main takeaway for me is its sheer positivity and lust for life. According to Noel, it is about the glory of being a teenager and was a response to the destructive and morose grunge music that was popular at the time. In fact, the album’s third single, Live Forever (voted the best British song ever in a 2018 NME poll ) was inspired by the Nirvana song I Hate Myself and Want to Die (1993). Live Forever by Oasis from the album Definitely, Maybe. To Noel, the song represented the complete opposite of the optimism he wanted to get across in his own songs. And in Live Forever, despite “not having a pot to piss in” , Noel expresses his gratitude for simply being alive, and for being able to find beauty anywhere ,  even in things that could be painful. 3. Keeping it simple, and loud Spin magazine once described Oasis’s sound as “dense, structured, not particularly groundbreaking rock music” . But Noel was never trying to rewrite the rule book with Definitely Maybe. His writing technique, of taking bits and pieces from rock and roll’s past and reformatting them for a new generation , provided both freshness and familiarity. This allowed him to write catchy, heavyweight sing-along anthems that reached as many people as possible. As he said in a 1994 Guardian interview : “[If] you want to sell 5,000 limited-edition red vinyl seven-inches, that’s fine. Make music for a closet full of people in Bradford somewhere … but it doesn’t mean anything to anyone.” Racking up 86,000 sales in its first week of release , Definitely Maybe certainly shifted more than a closet full. And, thanks to technician Owen Morris, it’s likely that many thousands more people were listening to through neighbouring walls. Definitely Maybe was seriously loud down to a technique called “brick-walling” that Morris claims he invented during the mastering process. This involved pushing the volume to the very limit of what a CD could produce without distorting. This made Definitely Maybe one of the loudest-sounding records of its era and allowed it to capture the kinetic energy of Oasis’s live shows . I’d like to take this opportunity to apologise to my own neighbours for the noise pollution. 4. Lyrics So, with its catchy melodies ( Slide Away was so good that Noel recycled it eight years later as Stop Crying Your Heart Out ) and huge sound, Definitely Maybe was well on its way to grabbing and keeping our attention. But I’d argue that the lyrics are just as important, despite their simplicity and often-nonsensical content leading Noel’s critics to dismiss them as meaningless drivel . What was important to Noel wasn’t that his listeners took a single “correct” meaning from a song, but that they take one at all . Like the classic creative writing mantra “show don’t tell” , in Definitely Maybe, rather than telling us how or what to think, Noel presents us with a series of images and situations that invite us to figure out what they mean to us, which makes us active in the experience rather than passive . In doing this, Noel ensures that even the absurd images that are found in the likes of Shakermaker (“I’ve been driving in my car with my friend Mr. Soft/ Mr. Clean and Mr. Ben are living in my loft”) and Digsy’s Dinner (“your friends will all go green for my lasagna”) become meaningful and connect us still further to the album Rock ‘N’ Roll Star by Oasis from the album Definitely, Maybe. 5. Liam However great its songs, it’s unlikely Definitely Maybe would have had a fraction of its success with a different frontman. In Liam Gallagher, Oasis had one of the most compelling performers the UK has ever produced, someone who embodied the swagger and energy of the songs he was singing. On Definitely Maybe, we see more of a diversity of Liam’s singing style than at any other point in his career. His patented sneer on tracks like Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rock ‘N’ Roll Star is paired with the tenderness of Married With Children where, in the bridge section, his voice takes on a vulnerability he’s never shown since. Upon leaving Oasis in 2009, Noel said he “could not go on working with Liam a day longer” , but has since conceded that much of Oasis’s success was down to Liam’s singing and good looks . A rare understatement of his own importance to the group from Noel, but an even rarer acknowledgement of the role his troublesome brother played in making Oasis one of the biggest bands in the world.

        "article_text": "SpaceX , CC BY-NC-ND The Polaris Dawn mission has been attracting lots of attention because it will feature the first ever spacewalk by commercial space travellers. There are many reasons why this is a landmark mission. But, with its ambition comes a degree of risk. The mission is backed by Elon Musk’s company SpaceX and there are no professional astronauts among the crew. Flying aboard the mission is a businessman, a fighter pilot and two SpaceX employees. The mission represents an emerging parallel track in orbital spaceflight which is privately funded compared to the upcoming government-backed US Artemis missions to return humans to the Moon. The four crew members of Polaris Dawn are currently scheduled to launch in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday, August 28. During the five day mission, they will travel further from Earth than any humans have been since the Apollo missions, heading up to 1,400 km in altitude. In addition to the spacewalk, the crew will travel through portions of the Van Allen radiation belts – zones of energetic charged particles around Earth. This will allow them to carry out tests aimed at understanding the effects of space radiation on human health. Other experiments include one related to how the eyes and vision system respond in microgravity. The crew will also test a laser-based communication system in space. This will provide data for future space communications systems that could be used on missions to the Moon and Mars. The spacecraft’s commander is Jared Isaacman, an American businessman who is flying on a commercial SpaceX mission for the second time. The retired US Air force lieutenant colonel Scott Poteet will serve as the mission’s pilot. Sarah Gillis, is a mission specialist, and is the lead space operations engineer at SpaceX. Gillis is scheduled to perform the spacewalk, known formally as an extravehicular activity (EVA), together with Isaacman. Finally, Anna Menon is a mission specialist and medical officer on the flight. Like Gillis, she is a SpaceX employee who leads space operations and is a mission director at the company. The mission will be commanded by businessman Jared Isaacman. SpaceX , CC BY-NC-ND The spacewalk will be somewhat different to the type we’ve become used to seeing from International Space Station (ISS), where two astronauts will usually go outside while the rest of the crew stays inside the pressurised station. The Dragon capsule has a hatch rather than an airlock. This means that the spacecraft’s whole interior will have to be depressurised and exposed to the vacuum of space when Isaacman and Gillis exit through the hatch to carry out their spacewalk 435 miles (700km) above Earth. All four crew members will therefore be receiving their life support through spacesuits while the EVA is underway. The crew are wearing EVA suits designed by SpaceX that will be used for the first time on this flight. These are considerably more streamlined than those used by Nasa astronauts aboard the ISS. The design of the older Nasa suit, called the Extravehicular Mobility Unit , has stayed much the same for more than 40 years. However, the bulkiness of Nasa’s suits is in part because they have a life support system incorporated into a backpack. By contrast, during the spacewalk, Isaacman and Gillis will receive life support to their suits through long tubes called umbilicals which are attached to the capsule. Ambitious objectives The significance of the Polaris Dawn EVA can’t be understated. Spacewalks have been reserved for government-backed space travellers since Alexei Leonov became the first human to step outside a space capsule on the Soviet Voskhod 2 mission in 1965. The first spacewalk by an all-commercial crew is a key moment in the history of spaceflight. The ambitious objectives of this mission, however, do also make it somewhat dangerous. While all the crew members are extremely capable and have been well trained for this mission, there are no professional astronauts aboard to advise. It is also the first spaceflight for three of the four crew members. Having said all this, Polaris Dawn is an inspiring endeavour. It’s common these days to hear criticism of spaceflight along the lines of: “instead of going to space, why don’t rich people give away some of their money to those in need on Earth?” During Inspiration4 , Jared Isaacman’s first spaceflight, aboard a Crew Dragon capsule , the businessman raised more than US$240 million (£181 million) for the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. For this mission, he is planning to replicate that success. The Polaris Dawn website allows internet users to donate to the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital , with the goal of improving the detection and treatment of childhood cancer around the globe. The crew members will also conduct several health-related experiments during the mission, with the aim of advancing medical research. This is the first of three missions in a privately-funded Polaris Program. As more commercial missions take place, the cost of access to orbit will come down. This will help democratise spaceflight, opening it up to those who are not professional astronauts or super-rich. Hopefully, it will also inspire the younger generation to see space not as the final frontier, but as a natural expansion of humans beyond the limits of Earth. The mission will use the Dragon spacecraft named Resilience, which is the vehicle flown in 2020 for the first full mission to launch US astronauts from American soil following the retirement of the Nasa space shuttle a decade earlier. The connection between the achievements of the past and the amazing results of the present is the most intriguing part of the story here. At least that’s how I see it as a child of the Apollo era, and apparently now, as a member of the Artemis generation.

        "article_text": "VesnaArt/Shutterstock For a not insubstantial fee, many private clinics in the UK offer full-body MRI scans to detect disease and abnormalities at the earliest stage. Kim Kardashian and Kate Hudson are fans . (Other celebrity endorsements are available.) So how do these scans work and are they “life saving” , as Kardashian suggests? MRI produces 3D detailed anatomical images of almost every internal structure in the human body, including the organs, bones, muscles and blood vessels. MRI scanners create images of the body using a large magnet and radio waves. Unlike X-rays or CT, it doesn’t rely on ionising radiation, which can very slightly increase the risk of cancer. Prices of full body scans in the UK range from £1,000 to £3,000. While they give a good basic overview of your anatomy, they don’t optimise the view of each organ or system. Any unusual findings would need to be further investigated by specialised MRI scans for things such as the heart and prostate . This is because the machine needs to be adjusted to different parameters to optimise the imaging of different organs and systems. It’s important to note that MRI scans cannot detect most preventable diseases. Heart disease, high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes are responsible for most deaths . MRI scans cannot detect these conditions. They may show some structural changes, but other symptoms will probably have emerged first. Full-body MRI scans may find abnormalities, often referred to as “incidentalomas” because they are just incidental findings, on scans being undertaken for other symptoms. Studies looking at over 16,000 brain MRI scans of volunteers have shown that less than 4% of them contained abnormalities that required further investigation. The kind of things found on brain scans include pituitary abnormalities, such as non-cancerous growths . Disrupted blood flow to the brain (without symptoms) has been detected in 7%, aneurysms in 1.8% and benign tumours in 1.6% of the population . Small clusters of abnormal blood vessels, known as cavernomas, rarely cause symptoms and are seen in about one in 600 people on MRI scans . Those that do cause symptoms are seen in about one in 400,000 people . Another area of the body that often throws up incidental findings is the spine. There is increasing use of MRI in back pain . This can lead to the discovery of incidentalomas such as harmless bone growths and haemangiomas, small growths of blood vessels on or in the spine. Haemangiomas are seen in over 40% of people who receive MRI scans, 99% of which cause no symptoms and don’t need treatment. The 1% who have symptoms, such as pain, numbness or weakness, require surgery to prevent progression towards paralysis. Tarlov cysts , an outpouching around nerves leaving the spinal cord in the sacral region (near the bottom of the spine) are seen in about 4% of the population . For most, there are no symptoms. But those who have symptoms, such as pain and numbness, may need surgery to prevent bone decay or damage to the nerve supply to the legs, pelvic structures and genitals. What about serious findings? A meta-analysis (a study that combines data from many studies) suggests that serious problems that are picked up by chance on MRI scans are 1.4% for the brain, 1.3% for the chest and 1.9% for the abdomen . There is also a risk that these scans give a false positive – things that look like disease but aren’t. Breasts ( up to 97 false positives per 1,000 scans ) and prostate ( 29 per 100 scans ) are particularly susceptible to false positive results. These scans may give some valuable information about what is going on beneath your skin. However, for many people, the reports and terminology used in them are hard to fathom. There is lots of evidence that the average person struggles to understand common medical phrases and often assign meaning opposite to what the doctor intended – for a single diagnosis . Reports resulting from these scans are about the whole body and will contain significantly higher levels of medical information than a single diagnosis – even when everything is normal. Where people pay for these scans without the wherewithal to cover any follow-up medical investigation, it will be already overstretched healthcare systems that have to pick up the fallout and ensure that false positives and benign growths are confirmed as such. These scans offer an opportunity to see what’s going on internally – for those with enough money to afford them – but the likelihood of finding something that needs urgent medical treatment is low. If I had the money to spend on one of these, I’d spend it on a holiday, which would be far better for my health.

        "article_text": "At the end of June, the US Supreme Court upheld an Oregon city’s ban on outdoor camping. The court’s decision means that people experiencing homelessness can be arrested, ticketed and fined for sleeping outside, even when there are no alternatives . The case centred on the city of Grants Pass where, in 2019, a class action lawsuit was brought against the municipal authorities for fining and jailing people who were sheltering outdoors in tents. A judge found that enforcing such a ban would amount to “cruel and unusual punishment”, but this was overturned once it reached the Supreme Court. Estimates from the US suggest that around 653,000 people experience homelessness on any given night. In Canada, the number is around 32,000 . The US rate per capita is about 1.5 times that of Canada, though this varies widely across different cities and regions. Makeshift tent encampments providing basic spaces of shelter and safety have been established across North America, acting as stark visual reminders of growing housing crises. As a result, the question of whether authorities should be allowed to ban people from sleeping in public spaces is rising up the political agenda. Growing homelessness numbers and the appearance of small collections of tents in London , as well as an asylum seeker encampment in Dublin, are bellwethers for how this phenomenon could emerge elsewhere . City authorities enacting bans cite concerns for public and personal safety and the erosion of public access to the pavements and parks on which the camps are set up. But academics and advocates have pointed out that the encampments are often the result of overcrowding in local shelter systems. For many people, there is simply no alternative. Municipal crackdowns can be particularly violent yet remain ineffective. They force people to disperse from a space of relative security with no thought for where they might end up. The “ street sweeps ” cause people to lose their belongings and to disperse across the city, severing connections to social networks and services. This happens again and again, as people set up camp elsewhere. The instability this causes has been shown to increase the risk of infectious disease, substance use overdose, and serious physical and mental health conditions. Courts are now frequently being called upon to mediate and clarify the conditions under which people are allowed to set up shelter. I have been researching these tensions in British Columbia, Canada , where over the past 25 years, 24 sheltering cases have been brought to the courts. As with Grants Pass v Johnson, many of these cases draw on arguments that centre on the human rights of those experiencing homelessness. Historically, courts have overwhelmingly ruled to clear encampments. However, recent developments have signalled a shift in this trend and the growing recognition of a “right to shelter”. The right to shelter This right, newly emerging in British Columbia, builds on a precedent set in the 2009 case Victoria (City) v Adams . The court found that, in cases where there is inadequate indoor shelter available, people should be able to set up shelter outdoors. Since this decision, four subsequent cases have drawn on and built upon this principle. Research shows that being able to shelter in public space can be critical for the dignity and lives of people experiencing homelessness. A 2022 decision meant that people sheltering at the Crab Park encampment in Vancouver could remain in the waterfront park. The relative security of having a permitted location has allowed charities and support networks to set up, providing food and other basics as well as harm-reduction resources such as addiction support, and linking people to local housing support. This decision broadened the scope of the right to shelter, expanding the definition of “inadequate indoor shelter” from solely concerning the number of beds free, to a broader consideration of whether these beds are genuinely available and suitable. Some municipal authorities have sought to bypass , or simply ignore , these decisions. Local residents in Vancouver have argued that the Crab Park encampment stops others from accessing that section of the park and so it should be closed . The city seems to be following a similar logic. By clearing encampments, authorities are testing and revealing the limits of the law as a tool to protect the rights of people experiencing homelessness. Despite this, these “right to shelter” court decisions remain important because they shift our legal understanding of the role of public space. Public spaces are now becoming an important part of the provision of emergency shelter and the housing continuum (the range of housing options available in the city). Society is being forced to radically reconsider what, and who, public space is really for. Researchers have long recognised that a “public” designation does not guarantee open and equal access to space . Throughout history, there have been countless examples of different groups of people being excluded from public space based on racist and discriminatory stereotypes. If we know that public space is never truly public, is it such a leap to recognise that providing shelter for society’s most vulnerable, and frequently most punished, is a legitimate use of public space? If more courts accept this and move in the direction of granting a “right to shelter”, it could rewrite the story of homelessness and housing around the world.

It also has a characteristic trilling call . This wetland dweller is only found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a concentration in South Africa’s Western Cape province . The species is one of about 140 members worldwide of the Rallidae, the bird family that includes coots, moorhens, gallinules, rails, crakes and flufftails. In southern Africa there are about 15 representatives of the family. African rail. A Oosthuizen / Getty Images In science, a “holotype” is the type specimen upon which the description and name of a new species is based. These are usually preserved or described specimens. The African rail is unusual in this regard: the species holotype is a 1773 watercolour painting by Georg Foster, now housed in the Natural History Museum in London . Foster was an artist on board British explorer Captain James Cook’s second expedition (1772-1775), which aimed to determine if a great southern continent, “ Terra Australis ”, existed. En route to the southern ocean the expedition stopped at the Cape of Good Hope (now Cape Town), where Foster created the painting. The holotype of the African rail, a 1773 watercolour painting by Georg Foster. Natural History Museum Now we believe we’ve found a far earlier representation of the species. We are members of the African Centre for Coastal Palaeoscience at South Africa’s Nelson Mandela University, where we study fossil tracks, traces and images. In a recent research article , we described what we interpret as a painting of an African rail, found on the walls of a rock shelter in the Western Cape, south of the Langeberg range of mountains. At its longest it measures 20cm; it is the largest image in a panel of rock art by a San artist that includes probable images of bees, humans, an aardvark, antelope and plants. While it is not possible to establish the exact age of the rock art, it likely dates back centuries or even thousands of years. If our interpretation is correct it would almost certainly predate Foster’s holotype image. It would also underscore the depth of indigenous knowledge, exemplified by San people who were the original indigenous inhabitants of the region, and who left a remarkable legacy of rock art. The rock painting The San were (and remain) accomplished ornithologists (bird experts). Western explorers have related how the San had names for as many as 68 out of 76 species identified during a single day. The San also considered the thought processes and values of birds to be similar to those of humans, and thought that birds would react to many situations in the same way that humans would. The artist who created this painting has captured the “ giss or jizz ” (an acronym of “general impression of size and shape”) of the African rail, showing its widely spaced feet and forward-angled legs. Whereas most examples of San avian rock art, such as depictions of kingfishers, swifts, vultures or herons, can only be identified to family level, we contend that identification to species level is possible in this case. This is exemplified by the 14 sub-parallel bars on the flanks and under the tail coverts that closely resemble the pattern in the African rail. Such prominent barring does not occur in any other member of the rail family in the region. Half-human, half-bird However, the image does not simply depict an African rail, and this hints at a spiritual dimension to the purpose of the painting. Often San rock art images take the form of therianthropes , which are half-animal, half-human forms. The term “avianthrope” is used to describe images that contain both birdlike and human features. There are at least two examples of this in the African rail image. First is the absence of the bill, which gives the image a more human appearance. Second is the orientation of the toes. The African rail has long toes, three  pointing forward and one pointing backwards. In the San image four or five forward-pointing digits are depicted, imbuing it with human hand-like characteristics. We considered that the absence of the bill might have been due to the disappearance of pigment, and that the pattern and number of the toes might represent an artistic error. But we rejected these notions in favour of the artist deliberately creating what might be mistaken for anomalies and essentially creating a “rail-person”. Why would a San artist wish to create an image of an African rail? We cannot claim to understand the mind of an individual artist and can only speculate. However, we noted in our paper that the rock shelter lies very close to the African rail’s preferred habitat, a wetland with reedbeds. And the bird’s distinctive features and call would have rendered it easily recognisable and memorable. Red was an important colour for the San due to its links to blood. Furthermore, as with some other rails, the African rail can compress itself laterally and become almost two-dimensional. This is the origin of the term “as thin as a rail” and its unusual ability allows the rail to pass easily between vertical reeds and disappear quickly into a reedbed. We suggested that the “rail-person” may have been a conduit for the San to the spirit-world beyond the reedbed. A similar theory has been advanced for avianthropes of swifts or swallows entering a spirit-world behind the rock face . A rich culture and worldview Tragically, the San were relentlessly pursued, persecuted and killed by various colonists, mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were essentially wiped out from many parts of southern Africa. However, the richness of their culture and worldview is now widely recognised. They were among the finest trackers the world has known. San master-trackers from Namibia are now assisting our research team with fossil track recognition, and have recently identified, among other discoveries, fossilised ostrich tracks which would otherwise have been missed. The African rail painting which we have described can take its place as the oldest known example of its kind, and can provide a window into the world of the knowledgeable field ornithologists of a distant past.

Wikimedia Commons Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) was one of the most famous figures of his time, not only in his native Prussia but throughout the world. In addition to being a leading geographer, climatologist, ecologist and oceanographer, he attached great importance to the dissemination of knowledge to society as a whole. Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) – painting by Julius Schrader. Wikimedia commons He devoted much of his life to lecturing and publishing books and articles, with a single-minded commitment that would eventually led him to financial ruin. Humboldt is one of the ten masters whose lives and works I recount in my recent book Grandes comunicadores de la ciencia. De Galileo a Rodríguez de la Fuente (Great Scientific Communicators: From Galileo to Rodrigez de la Fuente) , edited by Comares and Fundación Lilly and released this year. A life of adventure In 1799 Humboldt requested permission from King Charles IV of Spain to explore the Spanish colonies in America. Against all odds, the monarch authorised the trip, apparently impressed by the young man’s knowledge and the arsenal of scientific instruments at his disposal. Before embarking for America, Humboldt travelled through Spain, taking measurements that proved the Iberian Peninsula is essentially a plateau. During his travels he aroused the suspicions of local villagers, who thought he was worshipping the moon when he made his nocturnal observations. Illustration of an Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) Humboldt University of Berlin , CC BY His voyage left the port of A Coruña and took him, together with the French botanist Aimé Bonpland , through lands that today belong to Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Cuba and the United States. It was a true adventure, full of such dangers as a jaguar attack, a rough journey along the Orinoco River that almost ended in shipwreck, and a collapsing ice wall during the ascent of a volcano in the Andes. He also unsuccessfully attempted to summit Chimborazo , but did manage to set a new record by reaching an altitude of 5,610 metres, the highest point known to be reached by a human at the time. A pioneering environmentalist The expedition served to collect scientific data on plants, animals, minerals and climate. Around 60,000 plant species were identified, of which about 1,500 were new to science. Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland by the River Casiquiare in the Amazon (oil painting by Eduard Ender, circa 1850). Wikimedia commons , CC BY Humboldt was an early proponent of ecology, conceiving the universe as a system in which everything is interconnected, and was also the first to highlight the effects of human action on the climate . Analysing the changes in Lake Valencia (in modern-day Venezuela) , he deduced that when forests were destroyed to make way for farmland, springs and rivers dried up. He also noted that every time heavy rains fell on mountain peaks, the rainwater formed channels that washed away loose soil, causing floods. A self-funded author The Basaltic prisms of Santa María Regla, by Alexander von Humboldt, published in the book ‘Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas’. Wikimedia commons After his voyage, Humboldt returned to Europe and devoted himself to sharing his findings. He published 32 volumes of his Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America between 1814 and 1831. He subsequently published five volumes of his magnum opus, Cosmos, between 1845 and 1848, which aimed to be a compendium of all existing knowledge of natural science at the time. Many of these books were printed in large folios, containing more than 1,400 sumptuous artworks by the best illustrators of the time. In their original edition, some of these volumes were so heavy that two people were needed to carry them. These costly publications were paid for by Humboldt himself, eventually leading him to bankruptcy. Reaching the widest possible audience In addition to books, Humboldt’s interest in democratising science led him to use all platforms available to him. He published around 750 articles in the most important newspapers and magazines of his time, including the German paper Allgemeine Zeitung , The Economist, The Times, The New York Times and the Caracas-based Diario de Avisos, among many others. Humboldt was also a gifted speaker. He gave 78 lectures based on his Cosmos writings that, for a time, became the social event of the moment in Berlin. His democratising spirit led him to open them up to anyone who was interested, including women, who at that time were barred from accessing universities. Humboldt himself paid to rent and heat the large hall where these lectures were held, which could accommodate over 1,000 people. His entire oeuvre has an extraordinary literary quality. In his travel diaries he makes it clear that science and poetry are not opposites, but that they can, in fact, complement one another: “Descriptions of nature, I repeat here, can be sharply defined and scientifically precise without being deprived of the invigorating touch of imagination. The poetic must emerge from the sensed connection between the sensual and the intellectual, from the feeling of universal distribution, of mutual limitation and the unity of nature.” Whether through written or spoken language, Humboldt was able to captivate the public, which helped him to increase his popularity and, as a consequence, his influence as a scientist. His life and work demonstrated the importance of public communication in sharing scientific knowledge.

        "article_text": "kos1976/Shutterstock Just three weeks ago, Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock declared interest rate cuts unlikely in the next six months . But if there was any doubt about what’s going to happen to global interest rates, the US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell removed it on Saturday. Before an audience of central bankers from around the world (including the deputy governor of Australia’s Reserve Bank Andrew Hauser), Powell declared the long-awaited US rate cuts were about to begin . “The time has come for policy to adjust,” Powell said, with a refreshing clarity that left no room for ambiguity. “ The direction of travel is clear , and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” Rate cuts by the US Fed and other central banks will create a near-irresistible pressure for Australia’s Reserve Bank to follow. My tip? Australians are likely to get a rate cut as soon as Melbourne Cup Day, Tuesday November 5. Here’s why. What happens in the US will happen in Australia When the US Fed’s rate-setting committee next meets on September 17 and 18, it looks certain to cut the US Federal Funds rate for the first time since it began lifting it in 2022. The US would join the United Kingdom, China, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, Denmark, the European Union, and a host of other jurisdictions in cutting rates – some of them repeatedly – to shore up their economies. Financial markets are pricing in the equivalent of four ordinary-size rate cuts in the US by the end of the year. Given the US Fed has only three meetings left this year, this implies they are expecting at least one cut to be a double. Australia and the US aren’t that different The US story, as Powell told it over the weekend, is also the Australian story. Describing what he called the rise and fall of inflation in his speech, Powell explained inflation took off when consumer spending surged after the end of COVID restrictions. The supply of goods was unable to keep pace at first, and consumers switched their spending to services. Then Russia invaded Ukraine, ramping up energy and food prices and making high inflation a truly “global phenomenon”. What brought inflation down from late 2022 was a return to normal in the supply of goods and food and energy, and restraint in consumer spending brought about by a series of aggressive interest rate hikes. ‘Anchored’ expectations of inflation What has kept inflation falling without (so far) much damage to employment in the US has been surprisingly restrained inflation expectations. If workers’ expectations about future inflation remain “anchored” to a figure that’s low, rather than soaring with actual inflation, they are likely to be modest in their wage demands and be more likely to keep their jobs. Powell said it had been “far from assured that the inflation anchor would hold”. In Australia – as in the US, the UK, Canada and most of the rest of the world – inflation has trended down since late 2022. And, just as in the US, our expectations remain anchored. Australians expect further falls Each month, the Melbourne Institute surveys Australians about the inflation they expect in the year ahead. On two of the measures, the expectations are ultra-low. One is the so-called weighted mean , which ignores answers of greater than 5% and less than zero (on the grounds they are unrealistic) and averages the rest. It suggests we expect an inflation rate of 2.6% : right in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s target band and not outsized in any way whatsoever. Another measure is called the non-rounded inflation expectation . This excludes round numbers greater than 10 on the theory that if someone gives an answer of 15% they are not serious, but if someone gives an answer of 14.9% they are. This measure suggests an inflation rate of 3.1% : almost exactly at the top of the bank’s 2-3% target band, and again nothing to get alarmed about. Room to cut rates With US inflation well-anchored, Powell said the US Fed can safely cut interest rates to support the labour market, which is beginning to weaken , as ours is here in Australia, although more slowly . Those are the parallels, and they are strong. So the arguments for cutting interest rates in the US apply here as well, even if the timing is different. Australia moved later than the US on the way up and will move later on the way down. And there’s another reason to believe that the cuts about to be unleashed in the US will flow through to cuts here, probably quickly. The Australian dollar jumped after Powell’s speech. When Powell actually cuts rates, the Australian dollar is likely to climb further. This is because cuts in the US make the US a relatively less attractive place to hold money and Australia a relatively more attractive place. Cuts in one country flow through to cuts in another The more the Australian dollar climbs relative to the US dollar, the cheaper the imports that are priced in US dollars become – which is another way of saying the lower Australian inflation becomes. It’s the same for other countries. Merely by cutting their own rates, the US and other countries will be easing inflation in Australia. The more they do it, the more Australian inflation will ease, building up a stronger and stronger case for our Reserve Bank to cut rates. It’s why central banks tend to move rates together (albeit with delays). It’s why on Monday, Australian financial markets were pricing one interest rate cut by Christmas and a total of three by May . Traders don’t believe Australia’s Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock when she said interest rate cuts were unlikely in the coming months . They think what happens overseas will happen here too.

        "article_text": "Ann Hogson/ Shutterstock , CC BY After months of speculation , the federal government has announced what the cap will be for international students in Australia. In 2025, the number of international students starting a course will be set at 270,000. This includes both higher education and vocational education courses. This still requires parliamentary approval. The Senate needs to pass legislation to allow the government to set enforceable enrolment caps. The government has jumped ahead of its legal authority here because the process of recruiting and enrolling international students for next year is already well underway. Education providers need to know how many students they can take. With the caps coming on top of major changes to visa and migration rules for international students – there have been nine over the past year – the cumulative consequences are hard to predict. While caps will force some universities to reject students they would otherwise have enrolled, other universities may not be able to fully use their international student quota. Which students are capped? The government says the overall cap – which it calls a “national planning level” – will bring new student numbers “back to pre-pandemic levels”. However not all student categories are capped. As previously announced , school students, postgraduate research students, some English language students, and students in “non-award courses” (a category that includes exchange students), will not be counted towards the cap. We also have some new exemptions. These include students with Australian government or “key partner” foreign government scholarships, students who are part of “twinning” arrangements (where they do some of their course offshore and then come to Australia), and students from the Pacific and Timor-Leste. In 2025 only new international student commencements will be capped. A student will be considered “new” the first time they start at each education provider. If they start another course at the same provider they will not be counted as new. In 2026 and in later years, the government will have the power to cap all students. Unfortunately, accurate comparisons between the 2025 caps and previous enrolments are not possible using publicly available data. The definition of a “new” student is different and there is no published data on foreign scholarship holders or students who start at offshore campuses before coming to Australia. What does it mean for unis? The government says public universities will have a combined cap of around 145,000 new international students. The caps have been calculated with 2019 pre-pandemic enrolments at each public university as their base. For universities who increased their enrolments of international students between 2019 and 2023 a formula applies, depending on their “international concentration”. This is based on the percentage of their enrolments in Australian campuses who are international students. Universities with low concentrations of international student can have all their growth to 2023 included in their 2025 cap. However universities with concentrations above 37% will get to keep only 50% of their growth. This is likely to affect the more prestigious universities the most. This includes Group of Eight universities , such as the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland and the Australian National University. They will have to cut their commencing student intakes in 2025 compared with 2023 and 2024. Private universities and non-university higher education providers, which are mostly small specialist colleges, will only have around 30,000 new international students between them. What about vocational education? The vocational education sector, which includes TAFEs, will have an overall cap of 95,000 new commencing international students. The government says vocational education providers with a “higher ratio of international students” will receive lower allocations to encourage them to diversify. This will have a significant impact on vocational colleges that primarily serve the international student market. Will the caps be reached? What the government has announced for caps – which allows for some growth since 2019 and a longer list of exemptions – could be seen by some in the public university sector as better than their worst-case scenarios. Despite this, the number of new international students in 2025 could easily be much lower than 270,000. The University of Newcastle is among those regional universities that may see more enrolments. Haireena/Shutterstock , CC BY Migration policy change As I have previously explained , between late 2023 and July 1 2024, the government implemented nine migration changes that made Australia less attractive to international students. A tenth change expected later this year will make permanent migration more difficult for international students. By June 2024 these changes had already severely affected offshore demand for vocational education. Demand for higher education still looked normal as of June 2024, but this was before the non-refundable visa application fee more than doubled to A$1,600. On the positive side, the government says if its capping legislation passes the Senate it will reverse one of the nine changes – a ministerial direction on visa processing priorities. This has seriously disadvantaged less prestigious universities and other education providers through slower visa processing. Blocking student choice While fairer visa processing will help some education providers increase their enrolments, capping popular universities below student demand won’t necessarily help other universities in Australia. Few students who want to attend high-prestige universities or want to live in large cities will go to lower prestige or regional universities instead. They just won’t come to Australia. At the end of 2025 we are likely to find many universities and other education providers have not reached their cap, pushing the total number of new students well below 270,000. The Senate will decide Two days of public hearings for the Senate inquiry into the capping bill raised many concerns about caps. This includes worries the caps will lead to university job cuts . The inquiry will release its report on September 6. Unfortunately for the international education sector, the Coalition supports the idea of education-provider level caps. If the Coalition and Labor can agree on how to set provider caps, this part of the legislation will pass in some form. So the ongoing debate will just be about the detail of caps in 2025 and beyond. Correction: an earlier version of this article noted it is likely many providers will not have reached their cap at the end of 2024. This has been changed to 2025. Andrew Norton works for the Australian National University, which has said that the caps will reduce its international student enrolments.",

        "article_text": "The Albanese government faces a likely High Court challenge to its installation of an administrator into the construction division of the CFMEU. As thousands of the union’s members held rallies in cities across the country, its former Queensland secretary Michael Ravbar – who’s been dismissed together with almost all other officials – said he would launch a challenge against the legislation passed last week to put the union into administration. An administrator was immediately installed. Ravbar told  the Brisbane rally: “This is going to be the biggest challenge and the biggest fight that we’ve ever had, but we’re all up for it.  You’ve got to get control of our union back.” Ravbar urged  members to vote against Labor at the October state election and next year’s federal election, and attacked Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who he said had “always been anti-union”. The High Court action is likely to argue the Commonwealth lacked the authority to take over a democratically organised union and sack nearly 300 officials, who had not been convicted of any offence. No court was involved in the action. Earlier court proceedings that were underway, brought by the Fair Work Commission’s general manager, are set to be discontinued after the government’s action. The government said late Tuesday it was not aware of any CFMEU challenge. On Tuesday Prime Minister Anthony Albanese denied the claim by the union’s former Victorian secretary John Setka that the government had made “a deal” with the union that there would be no move for an administrator if he resigned his position. Setka claimed on Channel 7 at the weekend that after Nine sent allegations of malfeasance to the union, he had offered to “pull the pin today” so the union would avoid administrators being sent into the Victorian branch. He had conveyed this to the union’s national secretary Zach Smith. He claimed there had been talks between Smith, then Workplace Relations minister Tony Burke and ACTU national secretary Sally McManus. “At twenty to six the call came through, [saying] yes, there’s a deal. Now when you do a deal with the government you expect them to honour it,” Setka said. “I think Tony Burke has betrayed construction workers in Australia.” Nine published a series of devastating allegations of criminal infiltration of the union, bullying and bribery. The government immediately made it clear publicly Setka’s resignation and other actions by the union to try to ward off intervention were not enough. Albanese told a news conference: “Obviously we didn’t make a deal. The evidence is in what’s happened”. The PM said he “not quite sure why people gave [Setka] some more oxygen. But John Setka is someone who will always look for publicity.” Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather, addressing the Brisbane rally, said: “Labor has used these untested allegations to attack an entire union”.

As thousands of the union’s members held rallies in cities across the country, its former Queensland secretary Michael Ravbar – who’s been dismissed together with almost all other officials – said he would launch a challenge against the legislation passed last week to put the union into administration.

        "article_text": "The internet has been buzzing with rumours of a possible Oasis reunion , with the release of a cryptic post on the band’s X account that features only the date of of August 27 2024 at 8am, in the band’s iconic logo font. It was announced today the band will be reuniting for performances throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2025. Oasis were one of the biggest English rock bands in the 1990s and into the 2000s, essential to the Britpop movement , alongside bands such as Blur, Pulp, Supergrass and Suede. England’s answer to the grunge scene coming out of America at the time, Britpop was a brighter take on the rock genre, with catchy tunes and lyrics that often critiqued British culture. Oasis were known for hit singles, with 1995’s Wonderwall perhaps their most enduring. The band has sold more than 70 million records , had 22 top 10 hits in the United Kingdom, and were one of the only Britpop bands to crack the United States. But alongside their music, they were just as well known for drama between the two brothers, lead singer Liam Gallagher and lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. The band haven’t played together since 2009. Like many moments in the band’s history, their last performance – or lack of one – was particularly dramatic. The band was scheduled to play at V Festival, in the English city of Chelmsford, which was cancelled due to Liam’s bout of laryngitis. Later, Noel claimed Liam was actually just hungover, prompting a defamation lawsuit between the brothers that was eventually dropped . Their final show was to be at the 2009 Rock en Seine festival in Paris. But before the band played, they cancelled the performance. Noel then made the infamous post on the band’s website that confirmed the breakup of the group: It’s with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight. People will write and say what they like but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer. The two brothers then pursued other projects – Liam’s band Beady Eye, and Noel’s High-Flying Birds – and there has been a long-running, very public animosity between the pair, who have repeatedly said the band was never getting back together. But fans still held out hope the brothers would find a way to reconcile and reform Oasis. Now, 15 years after they broke up, fans will get the chance to see them perform together again. If you’ve only heard Wonderwall and are curious what the fuss is all about, here are a few Oasis singles (and B-sides) from their discography that Definitely Maybe might make you a fan, in no particular order. Supersonic Supersonic, Oasis’ first single, peaked at 33 on the UK singles chart. Technically only supposed to be a demo and apparently written by Noel in around half an hour, Supersonic shows the band’s ability to rock from the first buzzy guitar slide. Roll With It Roll With It was an important song not just for the band, but for Britpop. Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day in 1995. Dubbed “ the battle of Britpop ” by the press, Oasis lost the number-one spot to Blur’s Country House. But Roll With It is still a really catchy song that combines glam with the melodic and harmonic influence of the Beatles. Don’t Look Back in Anger A UK number-one single, Don’t Look Back in Anger is one of Oasis’ most beautiful songs. They wear their love of the Beatles on their sleeve here with the opening chords sounding like John Lennon’s Imagine and the video clip with their mop tops and coloured glasses. It’s not just a pastiche. Oasis put their own spin on classic 1960s pop, with chiming guitars, a winding chord progression, a classic, melodic guitar solo, and some surprisingly charming lyrics. Whatever Whatever was a stopgap single to tide the band over between albums. It is an overlooked gem, and one of their very best Beatles-esque tunes, with a gorgeous string quartet and a lyric insisting we should all be free to be ourselves. The Masterplan A B-side to Wonderwall – a tough act to follow! – The Masterplan really showed what the band was capable of, both instrumentally and harmonically. The use of dynamics works so well in this song. It starts out very small, and becomes a swell of textures with big horns, lush strings, keyboards, guitars and more. Stop Crying Your Heart Out Stop Crying your Heart Out is a surprisingly sweet ballad about resilience and hope for the future. Oasis lyrics could be abstract, or at other times incredibly simple, succinct and clear. This is an example of the latter. The grain of Liam’s voice and the grandeur of the lush arrangement makes for a beautiful track. Half the World Away Half the World Away was a B-side to Whatever, and is in contrast with the lush arrangement of strings and keys on the A-side. Sung by Noel, the song is quiet, acoustic and surprisingly poignant. Lyla Lyla is a later-era single. It combines the pop catchiness of a love song with psychedelic touches that really work. Perhaps the cleverest moment is the changing of time signature during the chorus – it might make it hard to dance in time, but it really works as a fun musical moment that doesn’t happen often in Oasis songs. Who Feels Love Who Feels Love is Oasis at their dreamy and psychedelic best – a groovy half-time beat, lots of backwards swirling guitars, and a drone that really makes you want to sway. A modern take on 1960s rock. Live Forever The early single Live Forever has become one of Oasis’ most iconic songs. Written in contrast to the grunge and alternative movements in the US at the time,  the song acknowledges the bad times (“Did you ever feel the pain, in the morning rain, as it soaks you to the bone?”), but also has a sense of hope: “We see things they’ll never see – you and I are gonna live forever”.

Perhaps the cleverest moment is the changing of time signature during the chorus – it might make it hard to dance in time, but it really works as a fun musical moment that doesn’t happen often in Oasis songs. The band has sold more than 70 million records , had 22 top 10 hits in the United Kingdom, and were one of the only Britpop bands to crack the United States.",

        "article_text": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were meant to go to the International Space Station (ISS) on a roughly ten-day mission. Instead, they have been “stuck” there since June, as the reliability of their spacecraft – Boeing Starliner – has not met NASA’s strict standards for crewed flight. After two months of testing, NASA has now made the call that Starliner will return to Earth in September without astronauts aboard . This will enable both NASA and Boeing to monitor the craft carefully as it separates from the ISS and makes its way home. Because human life is part of the equation, the data gathered from this flight will inform required changes for Starliner to be certified for crewed flight. As for Wilmore and Williams, they will remain aboard the ISS until February 2025, replacing two of the upcoming Crew 9 astronauts. With the ISS only operating for another 5–6 years, Boeing’s role in the program now remains unclear. Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore (in black t-shirts) on board the ISS. NASA What is Starliner? Boeing has been in partnership with NASA going all the way back to the beginning. From Mariner 10, to the Shuttle program, and the critical Saturn V rocket that took people to the Moon, the aerospace company has been a reliable and innovative player in the space sector. So it’s no surprise that when NASA was looking for a small reusable spacecraft, Boeing’s Starliner design was an easy pick. Over ten years, Starliner has faced issues getting off the ground. Setbacks are normal when developing new technology to meet NASA’s standards. However, software defects caused the first orbital test in 2019 to end without the uncrewed craft docking with the ISS. It was deemed a partial success by Boeing, as the spacecraft was able to make a soft landing back on Earth. But the issues would have ultimately caused the destruction of the vehicle if they had not been caught and corrected. A clear plan to address the issues was laid out, and another uncrewed test planned for 2020. However, the pandemic and even more problems, including a launch cancellation, pushed completion of this milestone to 2022. Boeing Starliner at the Cape Canaveral launch facility in April this year. Kim Shiflett/NASA Back to June 5 2024. After setbacks, mishaps and a launch delay, the Boeing Starliner Crewed Flight test finally launched aboard the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. But as the spacecraft neared the moment of docking with the ISS, some of its thrusters were not performing as expected, and there were leaks in its helium system. Helium gas is critical to push propellant to the thrusters, so this was a concerning development. The spacecraft was ultimately able to dock with the ISS and the astronauts safely disembarked. Starliner launches aboard the Atlas V rocket. Boeing The end of an era When NASA decided to end the Space Shuttle program in 2011 due to the increasing resources required, it became dependent on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to send astronauts to space. While there were many factors that drove NASA to partner with private companies and commercial space organisations, the motivation for the commercial crew program was clear. NASA needed reliable transportation to continue to send astronauts to space from North America at a price it could afford. This led to the Commercial Crew Program , with more than US$8 billion invested to develop, test and certify new transport vehicles. While NASA has always used commercial contractors to build space technology, the agency has then gone on to operate it. What makes the commercial program different is that now companies are being trusted to operate the services as well. Enter SpaceX Dragon and Boeing Starliner. Since 2010, each company has been awarded funding in different rounds to develop crew vehicles. In 2014, the largest amount of funding was split between the two companies, with Boeing receiving almost US$2 billion more than SpaceX. The latter is now about to send their ninth crewed mission to the ISS (ten if you include the private flight), not including the numerous uncrewed resupply missions they have completed. The International Space Station in orbit. NASA Where do we go from here? While the future of Boeing’s Starliner remains unclear, one thing is certain. NASA is going all in to see human spaceflight go further than ever before. Apart from SpaceX, companies like Blue Origin, Axiom Space, Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost and Voyager Space (just to name a few) have all received contracts from NASA to support the Artemis program , which aims to see humans walk on the Moon again by 2026 and to replace the International Space Station in 2030. However, no matter how much money is invested, space is still hard. While NASA continues its ambitions for human space flight, we are still a long way from being an interplanetary species.

        "article_text": "Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, whose final term in office ends on October 20, has presided over ten years of democratic regression in Indonesia. This has been marked by attacks on – and direct interventions in – the Anti-corruption Commission and the Constitutional Court. Both were formerly key government watchdog institutions. It has also involved intimidating and weakening the civil society organisations that helped deliver democratisation to Indonesia after the fall of former dictator Soeharto in 1998. Despite this, Jokowi’s popularity has remained at over 70% . In recent years, supporters have even proposed constitutional amendments to allow him to run for a third term . While these did not go anywhere, Jokowi remains determined to maintain power and influence after he leaves office. This has led to the building of a new alliance with his former rival and the incoming president, Prabowo Subianto, and attempts to create a family political dynasty by helping his sons win office. Jokowi’s son, the new vice president These efforts started earlier this year in the lead-up to Indonesia’s presidential election. Abandoning the party that had backed his rise to power, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), Jokowi threw his weight behind Prabowo by offering up his son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as Prabowo’s vice presidential candidate. To achieve this, Jokowi had to rely on his brother-in-law, Anwar Usman, who was chief justice of the Constitutional Court. In a blatantly nepotistic decision , a majority of the court helped Gibran bypass the 40-year minimum age limit for vice presidential candidates. Usman was removed as chief justice for unethical conduct, but the decision stood.  Prabowo and Gibran won in a landslide. Jokowi and Prabowo’s new alliance, the Advance Indonesia Coalition or KIM, soon became known as KIM-Plus as former political opponents quickly moved to secure a place in the new administration. Jokowi also seems to have secured a new political base to replace PDI-P. In what some have likened to a “ coup ”, Airlangga Hartarto , leader of the second-biggest party, Golkar, was accused of corruption and resigned last week. He was swiftly replaced by a Jokowi loyalist, Bahlil Lahadalia. Another son and ally running for governor In recent weeks, Jokowi’s ambitions to maintain influence have focused on the regional elections on November 27 and the opportunity to install two KIM-Plus candidates in key gubernatorial positions. The first is Jokowi ally Ridwan Kamil, former governor of West Java. Jokowi backed him to become Jakarta’s next governor, anticipating this would prevent the re-election of Anies Baswaden, one of Jokowi’s political enemies and critics. The second is Jokowi’s youngest son, Kaesang Pangarep, who Jokowi was backing to be the next governor of Central Java. Like his brother Gibran, however, the 29-year-old Kaesang faced an age-based roadblock. Kaeseng was barred from running due to an election law that requires gubernatorial candidates to be at least 30. But once again, a favourable (but questionable) judicial decision – this time from the Supreme Court – seemed to clear the path for him. The Supreme Court decided in May that candidates must be 30 at the time of inauguration. This enabled Kaesang to run, given that, if elected, his inauguration would occur after his 30th birthday. The Constitutional Court weighs in And then things suddenly came unstuck. The Constitutional Court, which many feel has become cowed and compliant under Jokowi’s rule, handed down two decisions on August 20 that blew up his plans. In a unanimous decision, the court emphasised the minimum age for gubernatorial candidates applied at the time of nomination as candidate, not the time of inauguration. The court also suggested it might invalidate an election in which an underage candidate ran for office. In another decision, the court drastically reduced the so-called nomination threshold parties require to put forward candidates for gubernatorial elections. Under the current electoral law, a political party – whether itself or in coalition with other parties – needed to have either 20% of seats or 25% of total votes in a provincial parliament to field a candidate for governor. The court reduced this threshold for parties to that of independent candidates. The result is that a party will only need 7.5% of the votes to nominate in Jakarta. This change matters a lot. It will allow the PDI-P, headed by former President Megawati Soekarnoputri, to nominate a candidate for governor of Jakarta to run against Jokowi’s pick, Ridwan. And she had been expected to back Jokowi’s rival, Anies. A proposed law sparks street protests These decisions led to a quick response. The national legislature (DPR), dominated by Jokowi’s coalition and led by a Jokowi loyalist, Deputy Speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, defiantly announced last week it would immediately pass a new electoral law. This would have reversed the effect of the Constitutional Court decisions in two ways: it would reset the nomination threshold to 20% (which would have blocked PDI-P from nominating a candidate against Ridwan) it would set a new age limit of 25 for gubernatorial candidates (which would have enabled Kaesang to run). The legislature planned to do this, even though Constitutional Court decisions are, by law, “final and binding”. This contemptuous treatment of the court and Jokowi’s blatant dynastic ambitions triggered a massive response from civil society, which, like the court, had seemed weakened in recent years. Protesters in Jakarta besieged the DPR, eventually tearing off gates to the legislative complex. Demonstrators holding banners that read “Emergency Warning” and “Democratic Emergency” soon erupted in other cities. There have certainly been bigger demonstrations in the past against the Jokowi administration’s policies, but, critically, these were enough to stop lawmakers from entering the DPR and forming a quorum. Dasco eventually announced the new law would be abandoned (for now). Kaesang then announced he would not run for governor of Central Java. As expected, it was soon reported the PDI-P would nominate a candidate for governor of Jakarta. It still unclear at the time of writing if Megawati will choose Anies or a member of her own party, but either way, Jokowi now can’t be sure his candidate, Ridwan, will win. What happens next? Jokowi has suffered a setback in his efforts to consolidate his power – and public humiliation, as well. But he remains a formidable political force and, when the time is right, he will want to respond to these challenges. A likely target is the Constitutional Court itself. It acted with integrity and courage last week to defy the dominant political elite. But for years, it has been the target of an incremental campaign to undermine its independence through pressure on judges and legislative amendments. The DPR now has before it a bill to amend the Constitutional Court law. It would not be surprising if this bill makes it easier for the government to remove judges, undermining its independence even further. Moreover, while civil society groups rallied so effectively last week to stymie Jokowi’s dynastic ambitions, past experience suggests they are unlikely to maintain the momentum necessary to prevent the bill’s passage. If that happens, last week’s dramatic decisions may well be the court’s last gasp. Tim Lindsey receives funding from the Australian Research Council.

The legislature planned to do this, even though Constitutional Court decisions are, by law, “final and binding”.",

        "article_text": "Is the Albanese government trying to cast Opposition Leader Peter Dutton as Australia’s Donald Trump? And if so, what’s the thinking and why is Treasurer Jim Chalmers in the vanguard of the charge? Delivering the Curtin Oration this week, Chalmers said Dutton was “the most divisive leader of a major political party in Australia’s modern history – and not by accident, by choice”. He divides deliberately, almost pathologically. This is worse than disappointing, it is dangerous. His divisiveness should be disqualifying.“ On any reading, this is extreme language – especially coming from Chalmers. In question time, the treasurer doesn’t mind launching cutting barbs against opponents, but he usually refrains from going over the top. As Chalmers’ attack appears to spray-paint Dutton with a coating of Trumpism, is this the politics of defence from a government feeling embattled, as much as it is the politics of offence? In the past couple of parliamentary weeks, Dutton was criticised by some commentators for concentrating on the issue of visas for Gazans. Surely, the argument ran, he should have been talking about the cost of living, which is what most Australians primarily care about at the moment. Chalmers said in his speech: \"Every question in question time last week was about the Middle East, and not one about middle Australia”. But if the Coalition had themed the cost of living in question time, it would actually have given the government more chance to talk about its tax cuts and other budget relief (which, incidentally, it is promoting shamelessly in government-authorised, taxpayer-funded TV advertisements – Labor in opposition once criticised that sort of spending). An important clue to Dutton’s thinking came in Tuesday’s Essential poll, published in the Guardian. It showed that 44%  agreed with the opposition leader’s call for a pause in the intake of Gazans. Just 30% opposed it and  26% were undecided. Whatever one might think of the Dutton stand – which lacked nuance and compassion – it clearly hit a political nerve. On another front, Saturday’s sweeping Country Liberal Party victory in the Northern Territory election doesn’t have direct federal implications, but Dutton would take some heart from it in relation to his own strategy. The new NT government won on law and order, an issue that’s a first cousin to the national security and visa concerns Dutton is seeking to exploit. In casting Dutton as apparently Trumpian, the government might also be noting the current mood change in United States politics. Kamala Harris’ presidential candidacy has swung the emphasis on to unity, positivity and “joy”. It has not just left Trump floundering (at least for the moment), but re-emphasised his divisiveness and the potential risks he poses. At present, two things are happening simultaneously between the government and opposition. There’s more deal-making on substantive policy (notably on the NDIS and aged care) than at any time since the election of the Albanese government. At the same time, the attacks on Dutton are intensifying. Chalmers is working to clinch an agreement with shadow treasurer Angus Taylor on more reform of the Reserve Bank. Meanwhile he is amping up the assault on the opposition leader to number 11. The positive side of Chalmers’s speech was overshadowed by the barrage against Dutton, yet Chalmers is at his best when he is constructive. When he’s in full attack mode, he sounds more than a little like Paul Keating. (From a distance, he even looks like him.) Chalmers has studied, forensically, the man who was treasurer and then PM. His PhD thesis at the Australian National University was titled “Brawler Statesman: Paul Keating and Prime Ministerial Leadership in Australia”. In it Chalmers wrote: “Keating employed numerous strategies in parliament. He sought to differentiate Labor from the Liberals and discredit the Opposition with slick put-downs and by listing the achievements of the Keating (and Hawke) Government. […]  He sought to paint the Liberals and Nationals as out of touch and not up to the task, highlighted internal dissension in the Opposition and pointed out the limited capacity of senior shadow ministers. \"His tone varied from sarcasm to contempt to enthusiasm for new initiatives, but the intensity of the attacks and the disdain for what he saw as an Opposition incapable of leading the country was consistently evident throughout.” It was a style Keating displayed both as treasurer and prime minister. In an interview with The Australian’s Troy Bramston, published last weekend, Keating described how he saw himself: “In politics, I was in the blood and gore business, fundamentally. But with big ideas always running it.” As Anthony Albanese loses the shine he had before and immediately after the 2022 election, and anyway lacks razor sharpness, Chalmers as attack dog may be useful for a government on the back foot. But if this becomes his longer-term image, how good that will be for the man aspiring to be prime minister might be questioned. In government, attack dogs can be popular with the journalists, who love the sport. But often not so much with the public. In 1993 Keating won an unwinnable election as attack dog par excellence but by 1996 it was another story.

        "article_text": "LittlePigPower/Shutterstock Iron deficiency is common and can be debilitating. It mainly affects women. One in three premenopausal women are low in iron compared to just 5% of Australian men. Iron deficiency particularly affects teenage girls, women who do a lot of exercise and those who are pregnant. The body needs iron to make new red blood cells, and to support energy production, the immune system and cognitive function. If you’re low, you may experience a range of symptoms including fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, headache, irregular heartbeat and reduced concentration. If a blood test shows you’re iron deficient, your doctor may recommend you start taking an oral iron supplement. But should you take a tablet or a liquid? With food or not? And when is the best time of day? Here are some tips to help you work out how, when and what iron supplement to take. How do I pick the right iron supplement? The iron in your body is called “elemental iron”. Choosing the right oral supplement and dose will depend on how much elemental iron it has – your doctor will advise exactly how much you need. The sweet spot is between 60-120 mg of elemental iron . Any less and the supplement won’t be effective in topping up your iron levels. Any higher and you risk gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, cramping and stomach pain. Low iron can especially affect people during pregnancy and women who do a lot of sport. Kamil Macniak/Shutterstock In Australia, iron salts are the most common oral supplements because they are cheap, effective and come in different delivery methods (tablets, capsules, liquid formulas). The iron salts you are most likely to find in your local chemist are ferrous sulfate (~20% elemental iron), ferrous gluconate (~12%) and ferrous fumarate (~33%). These formulations all work similarly , so your choice should come down to dose and cost. Many multivitamins may look like an iron supplement, but it’s important to note they usually have too little iron – usually less than 20 mg – to correct an iron deficiency. Should I take tablets or liquid formulas? Iron contained within a tablet is just as well absorbed as iron found in a liquid supplement. Choosing the right one usually comes down to personal preference. The main difference is that liquid formulas tend to contain less iron than tablets. That means you might need to take more of the product to get the right dose, so using a liquid supplement could work out to be more expensive in the long term. What should I eat with my iron supplement? Research has shown you will absorb more of the iron in your supplement if you take it on an empty stomach. But this can cause more gastrointestinal issues, so might not be practical for everyone. If you do take your supplement with meals, it’s important to think about what types of food will boost – rather than limit – iron absorption. For example, taking the supplement alongside vitamin C improves your body’s ability to absorb it. Some supplements already contain vitamin C. Otherwise you could take the supplement along with a glass of orange juice, or other vitamin C-rich foods . Taking your supplement alongside foods rich in vitamin C, like orange juice or kiwifruit, can help your body absorb the iron. Anete Lusina/Pexels On the other hand, tea, coffee and calcium all decrease the body’s ability to absorb iron . So you should try to limit these close to the time you take your supplement. Should I take my supplement in the morning or evening? The best time of day to take your supplement is in the morning. The body can absorb significantly more iron earlier in the day, when concentrations of hepcidin (the main hormone that regulates iron) are at their lowest. Exercise also affects the hormone that regulates iron. That means taking your iron supplement after exercising can limit your ability to absorb it . Taking your supplement in the hours following exercise will mean significantly poorer absorption, especially if you take it between two and five hours after you stop. Our research has shown if you exercise every day, the best time to take your supplement is in the morning before training, or immediately after (within 30 minutes). My supplements are upsetting my stomach. What should I do? If you experience gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhoea or cramps when you take iron supplements, you may want to consider taking your supplement every second day, rather than daily. Taking a supplement every day is still the fastest way to restore your iron levels. But a recent study has shown taking the same total dose can be just as effective when it’s taken on alternate days. For example, taking a supplement every day for three months works as well as every second day for six months. This results in fewer side effects. Oral iron supplements can be a cheap and easy way to correct an iron deficiency. But ensuring you are taking the right product, under the right conditions, is crucial for their success. It’s also important to check your iron levels prior to commencing iron supplementation and do so only under medical advice. In large amounts, iron can be toxic , so you don’t want to be consuming additional iron if your body doesn’t need it. If you think you may be low on iron, talk to your GP to find out your best options.

        "article_text": "The selection of Abigail Bradshaw as the new head of Australia’s cyber spy agency, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), sends a strong message. It confirms the government’s increasing intelligence focus on domestic cybersecurity, both to disrupt foreign influence operations and to promote better protection of our national cyber systems. The ASD is so far succeeding in its monitoring of foreign influence operations, but struggling when it comes to domestic cybersecurity. ASD’s evolving mission The initial remit of the ASD’s predecessor agencies was to operate as an arm of the Department of Defence by collecting intelligence through the interception of international communications (or “signals” in traditional military parlance). The aim was to collect information relevant to the national defence of Australia, its diplomacy and foreign military activities. As early as 2010, however, the distinction between the agency’s foreign and domestic operations started to blur. Today, foreign intelligence collection and support of the armed forces are only two of ASD’s five missions . Domestic cybersecurity is now a chief priority – and a starkly ambitious one at that. As the agency frames it in its strategic objectives : Make Australia the safest place to connect to the online world. Foster national cybersecurity resilience. This is a substantial mission for the ASD, and in large part justifies the massive new spending for the agency announced by the Coalition government in March 2022 under Project Redspice – an additional A$10 billion over ten years. The government described it as the biggest investment plan for the agency in its history. The agency also has two other domestic missions oriented towards threats inside Australia – countering cyber-enabled crime (including terrorist use of the internet) and supporting law enforcement. Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil made clear this new focus on domestic threats during a speech in parliament in June 2023: About a year before our election, our national security agencies informed the Australian people that, for the first time, the biggest national security challenges that we face as a country are espionage and foreign interference. It is largely for this reason that when Labor came into power in 2022, O’Neil, the new home affairs minister, was given a secondary role as a sworn minister for defence. This practice has continued with the ministerial reshuffle last month when Tony Burke was named the new minister for home affairs and cybersecurity – and sworn in as a minister for defence. Bradshaw’s domestic security background Like her predecessors, Rachel Noble and Mike Burgess, Bradshaw brings a more diverse range of domestic security experience outside the defence world than would have been the case for a leader of the ASD a decade or two ago. She previously served as the deputy commander of the Maritime Border Command, deputy coordinator of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, and head of the ASD’s domestically focused Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). She held the role as deputy director of the ASD itself beginning in 2020. Bradshaw’s fellow deputy director appointed to ASD at the time was the government’s former counter-terrorism coordinator, Linda Geddes. These two appointments confirmed the direction the agency was moving, with a very strong emphasis on domestic security. Challenges ahead Recent speeches by Burgess, now director-general of ASIO, confirm that both ASIO and ASD have \nlargely succeeded in their domestic and international monitoring of foreign influence operations in recent years. However, improving our domestic cybersecurity presents a much bigger challenge. Australia is arguably one of the ten safest countries when it comes to cybersecurity. And as a cyber power, the International Institute for Strategic Studies assessed that Australia sits in the same tier as the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Israel, China and Russia – behind the United States, and ahead of Japan and India. On the other hand, there has been a string of sensational cyber breaches in the country since 2022 in which the personal details of millions of Australians have been revealed. This includes the attacks on Medibank Private , Optus and Latitude . Australia is only gradually expanding its cybersecurity workforce and bringing private sector firms and even its own government departments into conformity with modest, mid-level indicators of security readiness. The new investments under Project Redspice will improve this. But Bradshaw will have to be even more enterprising than her predecessors to bring Australia close to being the most cyber-secure country in the world – and the most resilient.

        "article_text": "Shutterstock Death comes at us, unswerving, immense, pressing on us its only gift, infinite absence. Mostly we face away from it. Too often we are faintly reminded of it when we deal with losses of one kind or another. Elizabeth Bishop came at this connection in her own querulously open-hearted way when she began her famous poem of loss with, “The art of losing isn’t hard to master.” And when a 26-year-old Tennyson, confronting the sudden death of his close friend and soon-to-be brother-in-law, wrote , “Break, break, break/On thy cold grey stones, O sea!” his words almost howl at the vast inhuman presence of careless death. But it is one (sometimes profound) thing to see and respond to the immanence of death in the world, and another thing entirely when a person you love, someone you might have raised from childhood or known intimately for decades, suddenly and too early dies. This exposes each one who experiences it to almost unbearable pain and almost complete darkness in the soul. Warwick McFadyen, a journalist and poet, has published two short books, which he calls “tidal charts”, detailing his thoughts, feelings and memories in response to the sudden death of his son , Hamish, who died at the age of 21 in 2019. Review: The Ocean: a meditation, in prose and poetry on grief/The Centre of Zero: poems 2019-2024 – Warwick McFadyen (McFadyen Media) As with Nick Cave’s recent discussions with Sean O’Hagan in the book Faith, Hope and Carnage , there is no escaping the raw and catastrophic despair the loss of a child presses upon a parent. Both Cave and McFadyen take to articulating this experience in directly powerful and honest prose, and also take themselves towards song, lyric and poetry. Some, in their grief will fall into a prolonged silence, while some go to painting, some to dance, some to meditation, or renewed friendships. Almost any discipline we choose can be our negotiation between denial and acceptance, celebration and curse, between ongoing love and love stopped in its tracks. McFadyen’s book, The Ocean , begins with Every day I stare into the abyss, and say good morning. Before sleep, I go to it and say good night, adding, See you in the morning. The abyss sits on a shelf. The Ocean is a series of short prose reflections ordered chronologically according to the time elapsed since his son’s death, the first at two months and the last three years later. He calls his anguish at two months a “monstrous wave” and a dense, black, dead star in his heart. He writes of times spent with his son, their conversations, shared interests, in such a way that as a reader I wished I had known this beautiful young man. Sometimes the writing breaks into poetry or talks about poets who have written about death in ways that carry meaning for McFadyen – Shakespeare, Rilke, TS Eliot. Sometimes there are details of ongoing life, such as his attempts to know how to answer the well-meaning question, “How are you?” At two years, he writes, The here and now of him is like a small boat sailing from  me on an ocean too wide and too deep to hold it back. Sometimes, in the ever-widening parting of the years I think I can hear him say, let go dad, I’m gone. The changes in feelings are tracked in these pieces of writing while the pain and unutterable loss remains in every image he reaches for as a writer working at his craft. The need to keep feeling Nearly two and a half years beyond Hamish’s death McFadyen uncovers a diagnosis for his state of heart in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5): prolonged grief disorder. The diagnosis means doctors can now ask insurance companies to make compensation payments to those suffering this absolutely normal reaction to catastrophic loss. It will also mean that doctors can prescribe medications engineered to relieve such suffering. Naltrexone, a drug for heroin withdrawal, is being tested for this very purpose. McFadyen excoriates this deafness “to the murmurings of the soul”. His act of writing, his marking of time, his feelings expressed here are nothing like an expression of illness, nor themselves a manual for recovery or even a guide to healing. If grief is taken out of the landscape that is left after you have lost someone you love, he asks, “what is left?” “To lament is to love even when the object of that love has gone”, he writes, and somehow this assertion of the need to keep feeling is a much more important reminder than identification of this experience (so common to all of us) as a disorder. The later pages of The Ocean are given to poems in a short-lined free-verse style that swings between specific images of how the loss of Hamish comes at him again and again, with wider poems that take in nature, its cycles, seasons, and moods. It is as though this loss has at first forced these poems from him, then with this gate opened, the poet in him has been let loose to write about nature. McFadyen is a surfer, too, so it is not surprising  he turns to the ocean, to the seasons, to waves and the “lapping of each moment” as images of what he calls “the long leaving”. In the final passage of this fine and honest book, more than three years after the death of Hamish, he tries to lay down his reasons for writing of his loss in this way. For him, “language is the bridge for one soul to cross to another.” He wants, in doing this, to extract the right words, the precise words, while remaining true to the unplanned “tidal surge of giving voice to thoughts in prose and poetry.” Who knew that ashes would weigh the same\nin your arms as when you held him as a baby. Booktopia The companion book to The Ocean, The Centre of Zero , is a series of poems broken into sections under the headings Water, Light, Earth, Voices, Time. The opening section is a paean, a love song, a lament, and a sometimes joyous expression of his passion for the waves, currents, the movement of light on rivers and oceans. Later, within the section on Earth he writes of the plaque prepared for Hamish and “for the sun to kiss”. The poetry is simple, the feelings direct, and within this McFadyen holds the long ache of love for a child who was so vividly on his way into  life that those who loved him cannot stop keeping him alive in their love. These books stand as tributes to that young life lost and as manifestations of grief. They might not be what you want to read now but they might be what you will be grateful to read at a certain time.
