Bettman Collection via Getty Images It was midday on a Saturday, and Simonetta led me from the open front door of her home in southeast Chicago to her sitting room and settled next to her husband, Christopher, on the couch. In the 1980s, Christopher had worked a few blocks away at U.S. Steel South Works , earning three times the minimum wage with a high school diploma – more than enough to buy a house near Simonetta’s parents before their first baby arrived. Like their neighbors in southeast Chicago , Simonetta and Christopher’s expectations for work and home were set by the steel industry. Between 1875 and 1990, the employment offered here by eight steel mills created a dense network of working-class neighborhoods on the marshlands 15 miles south of downtown Chicago. For the tens of thousands of employees who lived and worked in this region, steel was a rare breed of work: unionized, blue-collar jobs that paid middle-class wages, with starting salaries in the 1960s at nearly three times the minimum wage . Opportunities for promotion, benefits and secure job tenure allowed workers to buy houses, shop at local stores and put away savings. The steel industry was more than just work ; it organized the spatial and social relations of this neighborhood. Homes and businesses on tree-lined streets spread out from the sites of former steel mills along the Calumet River. U.S. Steel South Works was on Lake Michigan, just north of the river. H. Michael Miley via Flickr , CC BY-SA Its collapse was devastating to people living in the neighborhood, Simonetta told me. As mill after mill shuttered in the last two decades of the 20th century, people began to leave to find new work – mostly service jobs – located far from southeast Chicago’s economic depression. As we stared at the silent street, I asked them, “Why did you stay?” Christopher paused, then said simply, “We had the building.” The couple owned their three-story row home outright after decades of paying off the mortgage. Sure, it had some crumbling corners and the roof sagged, but it was theirs. These four walls remained solid during and after the topsy-turvy years of economic collapse. More than just a form of equity or material space, this building was the foundation for their stability. Why do people stay in hard places? For the past 10 years, I’ve asked why people stay when their local economy collapses. In my 2024 book, “ Who We Are Is Where We Are: Making Home in the American Rust Belt ,” I used ethnographic research and interviews to study the long-term outcomes of deindustrialization in a rural iron-mining community in Wisconsin and urban manufacturing neighborhoods set amid the steel mills of Chicago. The causes of deindustrialization were macroeconomic and global – technological change, trade deals, environmental regulations and increased competition – but the effects were local. In the second half of the 20th century, towns and cities that grew up around industries that extracted iron and manufactured steel suddenly lost the core of their blue-collar employment. Steelworkers on strike at U.S. Steel’s South Works in 1952. During the industry’s heyday in Chicago, South Works employed more than 15,000 people at its complex on Lake Michigan’s shore. It closed in 1992. AP Photo/Ed Maloney Stretching from New York to Minnesota, the Rust Belt region has experienced five decades of nearly double-digit unemployment rates . In the wake of industrial closures, hundreds of thousands of unemployed people packed up their houses and sought their fortunes in factories or mines in the American South, or anywhere that wasn’t collapsing from economic depression. In the process, these deindustrialized places not only lost their grip on their residents but their place in the American story of economic progress, growth and resilience. But not everyone leaves. For this research, I talked with more than 100 people , like Simonetta and Christopher, to understand why people stay in these neighborhoods as jobs dry up and stores close. Again and again, they argued that their stuckness in place offered them stability in a chaotic world. Homeownership: A trap and a way to stay The people I spoke with often began their stories with a practical – and economic – concern: the finances and freedoms of homeownership. For many long-term residents, moving elsewhere was economically impossible. Depressed housing values meant they couldn’t recoup their investments by selling, and the process of moving is itself expensive. Yet they also argued that owning their house offered them a little piece of stability in the early years of unemployment. In the mid-20th century, good wages combined with federally backed home loans opened avenues of homeownership for blue-collar iron and steelworkers. In the 1950s, south Chicago’s business district, less than a mile from the mills, was thriving. Curt Teich Postcard Archives Digital Collection (Newberry Library) via Wikimedia Beginning in the 1960s, southeast Chicago transitioned from a majority rental community to one where between 60% and 70% of houses were owner-occupied . For Christopher, Simonetta and thousands of their neighbors, buying a home was a sound financial decision and a path toward achieving the American middle-class goal of building wealth through private property ownership. Of course, houses are more than simply material investments. Simonetta and Christopher’s house was also their family story. In the first half of the 20th century, Simonetta’s parents had immigrated from Mexico. Christopher’s grandparents had arrived from Mexico at the turn of the 20th century. Simonetta explained that since they had grown up in the neighborhood, when they got married, they wanted to buy a place within walking distance of their parents and webs of aunts, uncles and cousins. The mill neighborhoods’ proximity to Lake Michigan means fishing and beaches nearby. Calumet Beach, shown in 2021, saw racial conflicts in the early 1900s but became popular with the entire community by mid-century. Jamie Kelter Davis/For The Washington Post via Getty Images When they made the down payment in 1980, they benefited from plummeting house prices. Wisconsin Steel had just closed its nearby mill, and housing prices in nearby neighborhoods had already dropped by 9% . But they hadn’t expected the whole region’s housing bubble to pop. Housing prices in their neighborhood began to fall as U.S. Steel slowly laid off workers through the 1980s and 1990s. Even today, the median price of homes listed in southeast Chicago ranges from $80,000–100,000, less than a third of Chicago’s median of $330,000 . When the neighboring mill closed, their family networks were stuck. Simonetta recalled, “My father, my parents still lived in the neighborhood. They weren’t going anywhere. Where were they going to go?” She continued, “It’s not like we’re rich. I mean, the mill’s closed. We were unemployed!” People fish in the Calumet River, with the wall of the U.S. Steel South Works site behind them. The site has been considered for several revitalization efforts, most recently as a technology center for quantum computing. Amanda McMillan Lequieu , CC BY-ND Even if their parents wanted to sell their house and start a new life in a more promising location, selling in the economic free fall of deindustrialization would have cost them too much. Mass unemployment turned homes that were once sound financial investments into nearly unsellable liabilities. What is gained from staying at home? Even while the economics of homeownership limited options, owning property was also a haven when everything else was in turmoil. Having “the building,” as Christopher called their house, made their path forward simple: Put food on the table by doing odd jobs and commuting an hour-plus to the suburbs, and look out for each other. Home is also where family, socially constructed identities and familiar experiences coalesce. The people I spoke with drove me to their favorite lakes and parks, sketched maps to their beloved shops or hiking paths, and pointed out historical markers of industrial pasts. They celebrated the social networks that still anchored their identities in place – extended family, annual parades and regular school and work reunions. Wrapped In Steel: A 1984 documentary on the neighborhoods of southeast Chicago. Produced and Directed by James R Martin. Interviewees were quick to admit that the sprawling crisis of deindustrialization constrained choices and limited their options. But within the fractured scaffolding of postindustrial social life, a generation of long-term residents still belong to one another. “We survived, and that’s why we didn’t leave,” Simonetta said. “The community has changed, but where else are we going to go? I mean, we’ve been here for fifty-something years. … This is my neighborhood.” “That’s how you destroy neighborhoods,” Christopher interjected, “by leaving!” Amanda McMillan Lequieu does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.",

        "article_text": "In the 1920s, many women became more comfortable in their skin. But the facts of life remained in short supply. George Grantham Bain Collection/Library of Congress American women still have fewer orgasms than men , according to new research that suggests that decades after the sexual revolution, the “orgasm gap” is still very much in effect. One of the study’s lead authors at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction told The New York Times that the gap persists because many Americans continue to “prioritize men’s pleasure and undervalue women’s sexual pleasure.” As my research shows , these attitudes toward sexual pleasure have a long history. But so do efforts to push back against them. Almost a century ago, a pioneering American sex researcher named Katharine Bement Davis challenged the prevailing view that respectable women did not – and should not – experience sexual desire or have sex, except to please men or to have children. Davis’s 1929 book, “ Factors in the Sex Life of Twenty-Two Hundred Women ,” completely upended this thinking. By surveying everyday American women, she was able to show that it was completely normal for American women to have sex for the sake of pleasure. An unlikely advocate for sexual liberation Davis spent the first half of her career policing women’s sexuality, not promoting it. In 1901, after earning her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, Davis became superintendent of the New York State Reformatory for Women at Bedford Hills . While there, she studied the women in her care. Most female convicts, she concluded, were “immoral women.” Davis’ efforts to enforce sexual morality drew the attention of philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. In 1917, he invited her to lead his private agency, the Bureau of Social Hygiene , founded to study and combat prostitution and venereal disease. During World War I, Davis promoted sex education to curb sexually transmitted infections among soldiers and civilians. Through this work, she became convinced that sexual ignorance – not sexual immorality – posed the greatest danger to women’s welfare. Davis had long criticized the sexual double standard , which condoned men’s sexual experimentation but condemned women’s sexual experience. Now, she also recognized that this double standard promoted women’s chastity at the expense of knowledge. She complained that discussions of women’s sexuality were “taboo,” which resulted in “distorted views, baffled speculation, and unfortunate experiences.” Tackling a taboo topic Insisting that Americans needed accurate information to achieve “a sane outlook on all matters pertaining to sex,” Davis made it her mission to teach women about sex. But first, she needed to learn about women’s actual sexual experiences. Davis decided to undertake a large-scale study of what she called “the sex life of normal women.” Davis’ approach was a dramatic departure from existing studies of “abnormal” sexuality focused on institutionalized populations. “Except on the pathological side,” she remarked , “sex is scientifically an unexplored country.” Katharine Bement Davis was frustrated by the double standard that celebrated men’s sexual experiences and condemned those of women. Heritage Art/Heritage Images via Getty Images By contrast, Davis explained , she wanted to understand “the woman who was not pathological mentally or physically.” To that end, Davis distributed a detailed questionnaire to what she called “women of good standing in the community” from 1921 to 1923. The resulting study sample of 1,000 married women and 1,200 unmarried women was not representative – it skewed white, well-educated and well-to-do. But their responses allowed Davis to redefine female sexuality. America’s first sexual revolution Davis launched her study of women’s sexuality during what historians now refer to as America’s first sexual revolution . The second – and more well-known one – would take place in the 1960s . In the 1920s, as one commentator noted , a “revolution in manners and morals” was underway. Sex suffused popular culture. Contestants in beauty pageants displayed their charms in skimpy bathing costumes and short skirts.  Actresses flaunted their sex appeal on stage and screen. New attitudes about sex affected the daily lives of average Americans, too. Young women throughout the nation adopted the sexy look of “ flappers ,” the term used for women who sported short skirts, rolled stockings and bobbed hair. Prior to the 1920s, courtship often took place in the home, allowing parents to closely supervise couples. But the ubiquitous automobile – which one juvenile court judge had dubbed “a house of prostitution on wheels” – rendered adult chaperonage obsolete and granted young people unprecedented sexual freedom. Meanwhile, birth control activists like Margaret Sanger and Mary Ware Dennett distributed contraceptive devices and disseminated sexual information in defiance of the Comstock Act of 1873 , which had defined birth control and sex education as “obscene” and made circulating such materials a federal crime. Sex, secrecy and shame Even amid the nation’s first sexual revolution, the facts of life remained in short supply. According to surveys Davis distributed to married women, only about half of the respondents believed that they had been “adequately prepared … for the sex side of marriage.” After expanding her study to include unmarried women, Davis found that fewer than one-third of all participants received sex education from their parents. Many women didn’t know how pregnancy occurred. Some had been unprepared even for menstruation. One recalled that when she experienced her first period, “I naturally thought I was bleeding to death.” In place of information, many women imbibed shame. “Having acquired the feeling as a small child that any sex pleasure was shameful and a great sin,” as one respondent put it , some could never overcome their discomfort with sex. Another woman regarded all sexual thoughts as “something to be shunned like the devil.” One response succinctly summarized the problem : “Our present secrecy, fear, and repression are responsible for most of our sex ills.” Challenging the conspiracy of silence Many women were eager to challenge what one called a “conspiracy of silence” surrounding female sexuality. Study participants ended up providing Davis with over 10,000 pages of handwritten responses. She used this information to produce the nation’s first major study of women’s sexuality , a 400-plus page book brimming with both statistical data and personal stories. “ Factors in the Sex Life of Twenty-Two Hundred Women ” covered a wide range of topics, ranging from sex education to sex play. Running throughout the entire work, however, was one central idea: Women liked sex. Davis included data on birth control, same-sex relationships and masturbation. At the time, these practices were universally stigmatized and often criminalized. Yet significant proportions of study participants engaged in all these activities. Nearly three-quarters of married respondents reported using contraceptives. Many probably took advantage of state laws allowing physicians to prescribe diaphragms to protect patients’ health. Surprisingly, nearly 1 in 10 women admitted having abortions, even though the procedure was illegal in every state. More than half of unmarried women and nearly one-third of married women stated that they had experienced “ intense emotional relationships ” with other women. In each group, approximately half described those relationships as sexual. This was a remarkably high figure, given prevailing views of homosexuality as sexual deviance and state laws criminalizing homosexual acts . Nearly 65% of unmarried women and more than 40% of married women reported masturbating . Since nearly all physicians and pastors condemned the practice , Davis assumed the actual numbers were even higher. Davis’ data demonstrated that “normal” women experienced what one called “natural sex feeling.” In short, her study showed that many women enjoyed sex for its own sake. Davis believed that reliable data would lead to “more satisfactory adjustments of the sex relationship.” In other words, better information would lead to better sex. Davis paved the way for future studies that validate women’s sexual pleasure. While researching female sexuality, she established the National Research Council’s Committee for Research on the Problems of Sex . The Rockefeller-funded committee later subsidized Alfred Kinsey’s studies of human sexuality. Davis’ legacy lives on. The findings from the Kinsey Institute’s latest study show that discussing sexual pleasure still matters, particularly for women. It also suggests that Americans’ understandings of sex have improved over the past century. When Davis conducted her study in the 1920s, she found it “advisable” to define “orgasm” for participants who were unclear on the concept. Now, a generation of better-informed Americans ponder how to address a persistent “orgasm gap.” Anya Jabour does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.",

        "article_text": "Ohio National Guard soldiers move in on war protesters at Kent State University on May 4, 1970. AP Photo Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has expressed his intention, if elected to a second term, to use the U.S. armed forces to suppress domestic protests . The New York Times reports that Trump’s allies are marshaling legal arguments to justify using National Guard or active-duty military troops for crowd control . Moreover, as the Times notes, Trump has asserted that if he returns to the White House, he will dispatch such forces without waiting for state or local officials to request such assistance . I am a historian who has written several books about the Vietnam War, one of the most divisive episodes in our nation’s past. My new book, “ Kent State: An American Tragedy ,” examines a historic clash on May 4, 1970 , between anti-war protesters and National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio. The confrontation escalated into violence: Troops opened fire on the demonstrators, killing four students and wounding nine others, including one who was paralyzed for life. In my view, the prospect of dispatching troops in the way that Trump proposes chillingly echoes actions that led up to the Kent State shootings. Some active-duty units , as well as National Guard troops , are trained today to respond to riots and violent protests – but their primary mission is still to fight, kill, and win wars. Archival footage from CBS News of the clash between campus anti-war protesters and Ohio National Guard troops at Kent State University on May 4, 1970. Federalizing the Guard The National Guard is a force of state militias under the command of governors. It can be federalized by the president during times of national emergency or for deployment on combat missions overseas. Guardsmen train for one weekend per month and two weeks every summer. Typically, the Guard has been deployed to deal with natural disasters and support local police responses to urban unrest , such as riots in Detroit in 1967 , Washington in 1968 , Los Angeles in 1965 and 1992 , and Minneapolis and other cities in 2020 after the death of George Floyd. The 1807 Insurrection Act grants presidents authority to use active-duty troops or National Guard forces to restore order within the United States. However, presidents rarely deploy Guard troops without state governors’ consent. The main modern exceptions occurred during the Civil Rights Movement, when Southern governors resisted federal orders to desegregate schools in Arkansas , Mississippi and Alabama . In each case, the troops were sent to protect Black students from crowds of white protesters. The standoff at Kent State The war in Vietnam had grown increasingly unpopular by early 1970, but protests intensified on April 30 when President Richard Nixon authorized expanding the conflict into Cambodia . At Kent State, after a noontime anti-war rally on campus on May 1, alcohol-fueled students harassed passing motorists in town and smashed storefront windows that night. On May 2, anti-war protesters set fire to the building where military officers trained Kent State students enrolled in the armed forces’ Reserve Officer Training Corps program. In response, Republican Gov. Jim Rhodes dispatched National Guard troops, against the advice of university and many local officials, who understood the mood in the town of Kent and on campus far better than Rhodes did. County prosecutor Ron Kane had vehemently warned Rhodes that deploying the National Guard could spark conflict and lead to fatalities. Nonetheless, Rhodes – who was trailing in an impending Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat – struck the pose of a take-charge leader who wasn’t going to be pushed around by a long-haired rabble. “We’re going to put a stop to this!” he shouted, pounding the table at a press conference in Kent on May 3. Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed across town and on campus. University officials announced that further rallies were banned . Nonetheless, on May 4, some 2,000 to 3,000 students gathered on the campus Commons for another anti-war rally. They were met by 96 National Guardsmen, led by eight officers. There was an edge of confrontation in the air as student anger over Nixon’s expansion of the war blended with resentment over the Guard’s presence. Protesters chanted antiwar slogans, shouted epithets at the Guardsmen and made obscene gestures. Doug Guthrie, a student at Kent State in 1970, looks back 54 years later at the events of May 4. ‘Fire in the air!’ The Guardsmen sent to Kent State had no training in de-escalating tension or minimizing the use of force. Nonetheless, their commanding officer that day, Ohio Army National Guard Assistant Adjutant General Robert Canterbury, decided to use them to break up what the Department of Justice later deemed a legal assembly . In my view, it was a reckless judgment that inflamed an already volatile situation. Students started showering the greatly outnumbered Guardsmen with rocks and other objects. In violation of Ohio Army National Guard regulations, Canterbury neglected to warn the students that the Guardsmens’ rifles were loaded with live ammunition. As tension mounted, Canterbury failed to adequately supervise his increasingly fearful troops – a cardinal responsibility of the commanding officer on the scene. This fundamental failure of leadership increased confusion and resulted in a breakdown of fire control discipline – officers’ responsibility to maintain tight control over their troops’ discharge of weapons. When protesters neared the Guardsmen, platoon sergeant Mathew McManus shouted “Fire in the air!” in a desperate attempt to prevent bloodshed. McManus intended for troops to shoot above the students’ heads to warn them off. But some Guardsmen, wearing gas masks that made it hard to hear amid the noise and confusion, only heard or reacted to the first word of McManus’ order, and fired at the students. The troops had not been trained to fire warning shots, which was contrary to National Guard regulations. And McManus had no authority to issue an order to fire if officers were nearby, as they were. Many National Guardsmen who were at Kent State on May 4 later questioned why they had been deployed there. “Loaded rifles and fixed bayonets are pretty harsh solutions for students exercising free speech on an American campus,” one of them told an oral history interviewer . Another plaintively asked me in a 2023 interview, “Why would you put soldiers trained to kill on a university campus to serve a police function?” A fighting force National Guard equipment and training have improved significantly in the decades since Kent State. But Guardsmen are still troops who are fundamentally trained to fight, not to control crowds. In 2020, then-National Guard Bureau Chief General Joseph Lengyel told reporters that “the civil unrest mission is one of the most difficult and dangerous missions … in our domestic portfolio.” In my view, the tragedy of Kent State shows how critical it is for authorities to be thoughtful in responding to protests, and extremely cautious in deploying military troops to deal with them. Force is inherently unpredictable, often uncontrollable, and can lead to fatal mistakes and lasting human suffering. And while protests sometimes break rules, they may not be disruptive or harmful enough to merit responding with force. Aggressive displays of force often heighten tensions and worsen situations. Conversely, research shows that if protesters perceive authorities are behaving with restraint and treating them with respect, they are more likely to remain nonviolent . The shooting at Kent State demonstrates why force should be an absolute last resort in dealing with protests – and one fraught with grave risks.

        "article_text": "A person holds an electoral certificate from the 2020 presidential election on Jan. 6, 2021. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Over the past four years, Congress and state governments have worked hard to prevent the aftermath of the 2024 election from descending into the chaos and threats to democracy that occurred around the 2020 U.S. presidential election. A new federal law cleaned up ambiguities that could allow for election subversion . New state laws have been enacted across the country to protect election workers from threats and harassment. Technology experts are working to confront misinformation campaigns and vulnerabilities in election systems. But untouched in all of these improvements is the underlying structure of presidential elections – the Electoral College . Here is a quick refresher about how the system works today: After citizens vote in the presidential election in November, the Constitution assigns the task of choosing the president and vice president to electors . Electors are allocated based on the number of congressional representatives and senators from each state. The electors meet in their separate state capitals in December to cast their votes. The ballots are then counted by the vice president in front of members of Congress on Jan. 6 to determine which ticket has won a majority. The widely varied pros and cons of the Electoral College have already been aired and debated extensively. But there is another problem that few have recognized: The Electoral College makes American democracy more vulnerable to people with malicious intent. A state-centric system The original brilliance of the Electoral College has become one of its prime weaknesses. The unusual system was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 as a compromise that prioritized the representation of state interests . This focus helped win over reluctant delegates who feared that the most populous states would disregard small states’ concerns. Nowadays nearly every state has chosen to award all of its electoral votes to whichever ticket wins more votes in the state. Even if a candidate gets 51% of the popular vote, use of the winner-take-all rule in these states means they will be awarded 100% of the electoral votes. This is what leads to the “battleground state” phenomenon: Presidential candidates focus their rallies, advertisements and outreach efforts on the few states where campaigns could actually tip the balance. In 2020, 77% of all campaign ads ran in just six states that were home to only 21% of the nation’s population. In this way, the Electoral College system naturally draws campaign attention to issues that might tip the balance in these hotbeds of competitiveness. Electors from Wisconsin cast their presidential ballots on Dec. 15, 2020. Morry Gash-Pool/Getty Images A road map for bad behavior By doing so, the system essentially identifies the states where malicious people who want to alter or undermine the election results should focus their energies. The handful of battleground states are efficient targets for harmful efforts that would otherwise not have much success meddling in elections. Someone who wants to infiltrate the election system would have difficulty causing problems in a national popular vote because it is decided by thousands of disconnected local jurisdictions . In contrast, the Electoral College makes it convenient to sow mischief by only meddling in a few states widely seen as decisive. In 2020, the lawsuits, hacking, alternative electors, recount efforts and other challenges did not target states perceived by some to have weaker security because they had less strict voter ID laws or voter signature requirements. Opponents of the results also did not go after states such as California and Texas that account for a large share of the country’s voters. Rather, all of the firepower was trained on about a half-dozen swing states. By one account, there were 82 lawsuits filed in the days after the 2020 presidential election , 77 of which targeted six swing states. The “fake elector” schemes in which supporters of Donald Trump put forward unofficial lists of electors occurred in only seven battleground states. The popular vote alternative A majority of Americans say in surveys they prefer to scrap the Electoral College system and simply award the presidency to the person who gets the most votes nationwide. Dumping the Electoral College would have a variety of consequences, but it would immediately remove opportunities for disrupting elections via battleground states. A close election in Arizona or Pennsylvania would no longer provide leverage for upending the national result. Any election system that does not rely on states as the puzzle pieces for deciding elections would remove opportunities like these. It could also seriously reduce disputes over recounts and suspicion about late-night ballot counts, long lines and malfunctioning voting machines because those local concerns would be swamped by the national vote totals. Although not without its own concerns , an agreement among the states to award their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote is probably the most viable method for shifting to the popular vote, in part because it does not require passing an amendment to the Constitution . There is no ideal way to run a presidential election. The Electoral College has survived in its current form for almost two centuries, a remarkable run for democracy. But in an era where intense scrutiny of just a few states is the norm, the system also lights the way for those who would harm democracy. Barry C.

Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images Anita Diamant, the prolific writer and Jewish feminist activist , begins her book “ The Jewish Wedding Now ” with a simple statement: “According to Jewish law, the requirements for a kosher wedding can be summed up in a few words: a bride accepts an object worth more than a dime from a groom; the groom recites a ritual formula to consecrate the transaction; the actions are witnessed by two people who are not related to either bride or groom. That’s it.” But actual Jewish weddings are much more than that: They have before, during and after phases, and they vary widely throughout the world. To explore Jewish women’s experiences of their weddings, my new book, “ 100 Jewish Brides ,” co-edited with fellow sociologist Barbara Vinick , offers accounts written by Jewish brides – or their relatives, friends or clergy – from 100 different countries. The writers typically begin with experiences that occurred long before the wedding, especially how, when and where they met the person whom they would marry. Many Jews believe that one person exists on Earth who is destined to be their partner, their “beshert.” Brides also have heard wedding narratives from an early age, which they are eager to fulfill. An especially prominent theme in the brides’ stories is pre-wedding practices, both religious and secular. Cantor Rachelle Nelson officiates during a Jewish wedding ceremony in 2021 for Gene Yaffee and Faye Albert at The Palace Coral Gables, a senior living residence in Florida. AP Photo/Lynne Sladky The mikvah party Religious Jews prepare their weddings around halachic regulations – that is, Jewish law. These may include practicing “shomer negiyah ” – not touching each other at all, from the moment the couple meet until they stand under the chuppah, or wedding canopy. The couple may also fast on the day of the wedding. Sir Jonathan Sacks, the late chief rabbi of the United Kingdom , encouraged couples to use part of the pre-wedding period to draft a prenuptial agreement to prevent future problems around divorce . The pre-wedding obligation of mikvah, or mikveh – when the naked bride fully immerses in a pool of flowing water – is essential for observant Jews and is becoming attractive to non-Orthodox Jews , as the mikvah pool has modernized. In Jewish history, immersing is so important that a Jewish community must create a mikvah before building any other structure. The bride’s immersion before marriage has several meanings. The meticulous cleaning of her body symbolizes purifying herself for marriage and sexual intimacy and coming closer to God. For some Jewish women, the premarital immersion may also mark the start of her monthly immersion in coordination with her menstrual cycle. Inside a mikvah in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, N.Y. Mk17b via Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA In our book , women from Greece, Israel, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Yemen described their mikvah ceremony as both a solemn spiritual experience and a group celebration. “ Leona,” a charming Mexican film , opens with a long segment in which the soon-to-be-married bride swims underwater while her female friends and relatives sit around the pool laughing and singing. The mikvah party binds the entire group and passes the tradition on to the future brides. Zanet Battinou, from Greece, wrote about having her mikvah in the sea as her mother, mother-in-law, grandmother and friends sat on the beach. “My friends brought sweets to nibble on, and my mom-in-law prepared the traditional basket of luxurious towels, perfume, and bathroom goodies that every bride receives,” she recalled. “I have kept the lovely towels for my daughter to use someday, please God. My mikveh was full of love, meaning and reverence. I will never forget it.” The henna party A woman prepares to apply henna to women’s hands at a celebration in Israel for a Yemeni Jewish couple. Courtesy of Barbara Vinick A second pre-wedding theme in the brides’ stories was the secular henna party, where guests and professionals apply temporary dye from the henna plant to the bride or the bridal couple – and sometimes to the guests – to create intricate designs on their hands and feet. Similar traditions are common throughout many North African, Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures, across religions. Among Jews, henna parties are popular among Mizrahi and Sephardi families – those with roots in the Middle East and North Africa. Rachel Jacobson sent us a story about her relative’s henna party for 500 people in Marrakech, Morocco. “The women wore gorgeous caftans and many of them changed garments four or five times during the event,” she recalled. Both bride and groom entered the room on thrones carried by four men, as singers performed in French, Arabic and Hebrew. The couple was showered with jewelry, which covered the bride in gold and diamonds. Then a family member applied henna to all the palms of all the guests – men and women – who wanted it followed by nonstop eating and entertainment until morning.“ A bride and groom in Morocco enter their henna party, a treasured pre-wedding tradition for some Sephardi Jews. Courtesy of Barbara Vinick Intermarriage and conversion \"Jewish Intermarriage around the World,” a 2009 book I co-edited with demographer Sergio DellaPergola , examined data from 13 countries. One hundred years ago, most Jews lived in places where the rate of intermarriage was lower than 5%. Today, however, most Jews outside Israel live in countries where at least 1 in 3 Jewish people marry a non-Jew. As intermarriage became common, new rituals are created. Some ceremonies may use the services of both a rabbi and an officiant of another religion. In some cases, the non-Jewish partner wishes to convert, either before or after the wedding. This topic can create hurtful or welcoming pre-wedding plans, depending on the families’ commitment to the other religion and previous history with intermarriage. Gabriela Fraenkel, a bride from Uruguay, wrote about her intermarriage . When she met her future husband, Santiago, it was “love at first sight.” “Santi,” his nickname, “was Christian but not a believer,” Gabriela wrote. “After a while, he began to come with me to synagogue and Jewish holiday celebrations. … A few months later, Santi told me that he wanted to convert.” In Gabriela’s community, conversion required a year of study with a rabbi – and, for men, a symbolic circumcision, or “brit milah.” Their unplanned course of action – to wait a few years before marrying – may not suit most people, but it became a critical component for this couple that preserved “shalom bayit,” which can be translated from Hebrew as “domestic tranquility.” Women in Madagascar wait to submerge in a river, used as a mikvah, before a conversion to Judaism. Some of the women were also about to be married. Courtesy of Barbara Vinick A community is strengthened What happens before a Jewish wedding depends on how the couple define their Jewish identities, if at all. It depends on where the couple lives and on the families’ resources. And it depends on traditions the couple chooses to include or exclude. Despite these multiple roots, the shared outcome is the same: a strengthening of the Jewish community, a striking theme that permeates these stories. People come together and celebrate the couple and the institution of marriage. They are encouraged to comment on the bride’s beauty and to dance with unbridled joy. Even COVID-19 could not stop weddings. They simply changed from in-person to on Zoom . Jewish weddings are more than reenactments of the past. Rather, they acknowledge the present and adapt to many different demands. When the actual ceremony is done, everyone present breathes a sigh of relief as the couple stamp on a glass, crushing it to the collective cry: Le'Chayim! To Life!

        "article_text": "Many commentators believe that the world should move away from measuring economic success in terms of GDP growth. Yes, growth has brought prosperity and untold riches, but it has had significant negative side effects for the planet, including climate change, pollution and species extinction. None of these are captured in GDP data. A whole “beyond GDP” movement has emerged over the last several decades, arguing that we should adopt a new way of measuring the wealth of nations. There is an ongoing debate about the best alternative, and many indicators have supporters, such as gross national happiness and the genuine progress indicator . Yet one stands out as having by far the most buy-in from major international institutions. Known as “inclusive wealth”, it expands what we mean by wealth to include things like the natural environment and the abilities of the population. But it comes with a major problem. There’s no agreement around how it should be measured, so different institutions publish very different figures. In our view, this is a major obstacle to its mass adoption. Inclusive wealth Inclusive wealth ascribes a value to the assets a nation has produced that generate well-being, and measures how they are changing over time. These assets are: Human capital: the knowledge and skills of the population. Produced capital: goods and services produced by human endeavour. Natural capital: the sum of all nature-based assets from which humans derive well-being, both now and in the future. Social capital: the social networks that exist within a society. There is strong theoretical support for the idea that this approach is a good way of measuring the sustainability of economic development . The key point is that when inclusive wealth per capita is going up, the future wellbeing of the population will go up, which is a necessary condition for sustainable development. Foundational texts in support of inclusive wealth include Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta’s 2001 book , Human Well-Being and the Environment, and his Harvard counterpart Martin Weitzman’s 2003 book , Income, Wealth and the Maximum Principle. Dasgupta carried out a review for the UK government in 2021 into the economics of biodiversity, which similarly advocates for measuring national inclusive wealth instead of national income. There have also been recent calls by academics in this field to use inclusive wealth to help with the global biodiversity framework , a UN-led drive to be “living in harmony with nature” by 2050. Inclusive wealth is measured by both the World Bank and UN Environment Programme (Unep) . The World Bank has been measuring it since the late 1990s, and first published global estimates in a 2006 report called Where is the wealth of nations : measuring capital for the 21st century. It has since published three major updates to this report, including a major revision to the methodology, with another on the way. As for Unep, it began measuring inclusive wealth in 2012 . But there are still some kinks that need ironing out before this indicator can be of any practical use. In a new paper in Ecological Economics , we compare the approaches of the World Bank and Unep and find a big divergence in their calculations. This may explain why inclusive wealth has yet to be adopted in any serious way by any major economies (all we’ve seen so far is some mentions in policy documents, like this one from New Zealand, and a recent decision by the Biden-Harris administration to start tracking the value of US natural resources at federal level using natural-capital accounting). The discrepancies relate mainly to natural capital. Both Unep and the World Bank include similar if not identical data from the same components: non-renewables such as fossil fuels and minerals, and renewable elements such as fisheries and forest resources. The problem is that the institutions’ research teams value them differently. The World Bank approach comes up with a present value for expected future earnings by discounting from what they will eventually be worth. In contrast, Unep uses fixed accounting prices, referred to as “shadow prices”, which are based on market prices today. This leads to different conclusions about the trajectory of our natural capital, and thus, by implication, of the sustainability of current development paths. This is then exacerbated by another discrepancy around how the institutions measure changes in human capital. Country differences In our paper, we highlight the case of Qatar. According to Unep, it is one of the worst performers in terms of the change in inclusive wealth per capita, and so is judged unsustainable. Yet according to World Bank estimates, Qatar’s inclusive wealth per capita is growing positively. Which is it? If development is unsustainable, some remedial action will be necessary, but if it is sustainable, no problem. How is the Qatari government to decide how to proceed? We find similar conflicting signals for many other countries. According to the World Bank data, 20 countries’ inclusive wealth per capita is in decline (in other words, unsustainable), while the Unep data has 45 countries in decline. There is also little crossover in terms of these two lists. As many as 34 of the countries that the World Bank says have growing inclusive wealth per capita are in decline according to Unep. We agree strongly with the basic proposition that measuring inclusive wealth is key to ensuring the world develops sustainably. But there needs to be a more consistent approach for this signal to achieve enough credibility to be widely adopted. In our experience, the World Bank is much more transparent than Unep about the data in its calculations. Without full Unep transparency, it’s difficult to get to the root of the discrepancy. Having said that, both broad approaches have merits, so it’s more a question of everyone committing to a single approach than arguing that one is better than the other. Unless this measurement problem can be resolved, it’s difficult to see countries taking inclusive wealth seriously. That could have serious consequences in the battle to make economic development sustainable.

        "article_text": "Horseshoe crabs washed up on Nantucket Sound. Susanne Masters , CC BY-NC-ND The bright blue blood of the horseshoe crab is used around the world to detect bacterial contamination in vaccines . Synonymous with luxury, sturgeon caviar has been patented as an antidote to impotency in China. Rhino horn is used in traditional Asian medicine to treat various ailments, and is also an ingredient in 50 different recipes for snuff. Similarly, pangolin scales have been suggested as an ingredient in livestock feed, according to a 2014 patent. Wildlife products, even those that have been traded and used for centuries, are the subject of constant innovation, and that could be putting rare and endangered animals under increasing pressure. Market shifts are usually detected after trade – either legal or illegal – has become established. Since 2014, jaguar parts began replacing the more rare and difficult to obtain tiger parts in Chinese markets . As businesses make technological advances, they apply for patents to protect their commercial interest. These patent applications document changes in species, products and locations of wildlife trade. So patents can provide a window into innovations related to wild products . In our new research, published in the journal Nature Communications , we analysed the patents for products sourced from various species. We selected bears, Ophiocordyceps caterpillar fungus, rhinos, pangolins, sturgeon and horseshoe crabs, to cover a range of use types, taxonomic groups and trade legalities. Using machine learning, we analysed half a century of wildlife-related patenting, looking at patents from 1970-2020. Pangolins cannot be traded legally but they are still killed for their scales. CameraBaba/Shutterstock We used a method called “changepoint analysis” to look for the key point at which patent filing rate changed, and also “topic modelling”, which grouped together patents with similar topics (such as medicine, food or farming) based on a set of keywords. We could then pinpoint key moments when patent filing rates shifted and explore when or how commercial interest changed. We found 27,308 patent applications for the species we focused on in this study. Patent filing rates for them increased at 130% per year since 1988, more than the average of 104% for all patent filing. On a global scale businesses consider wild species an important component of future commercial trade. While we expected that legislative bans would reduce patenting rates for products using wild species, and potentially increase patent filing for alternatives, this was not the case. Changes in patent filing trends did not always coincide with regulations such as trade bans. Patents filed for illegal products also increased. For example, 426 patents for medicines containing rhino horn were filed in China after it was banned as a medicinal ingredient there. This included a proposed treatment for blood disease in 2016 and an anti-cancer food supplement in 2013. This may suggest that, in most cases, businesses have some confidence that these markets will reopen in the future. It could also indicate that the people filing patents are unaware of these regulations. One exception was a decrease patent applications for products containing pangolins and an increase in patenet applications for patents related to farming patents, for example formula for feeding young pangolins, in 2017. This was the year when pangolins were legally protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in the equivalent of an international commercial trade ban. Innovative applications Patents diversified over time. This included the emergence of applications for horseshoe crab blood in the electronics industry in the 1980s, and a new “environmentally-friendly” pesticide containing rhino horn, which was patented in 2013. A Cordyceps caterpillar is preserved in whisky for medicinal use. Susanne Masters , CC BY-NC-ND Sometimes existing products are promoted for a new purpose. Cordyceps , a caterpillar controlled by an infecting fungus collected in the high altitude Himalayas, was a popular traditional medicine and food supplement. Demand for these products soared after they were named as a performance enhancer for athletes at the Beijing Olympics. The medicinal use of pangolin scales was the basis for a 2019 patent for healthcare trousers, which have a pouch containing pangolin scales and other medicinal ingredients. Innovations aimed at expanding markets and increasing profits for businesses can lead to more wild harvest and trade of animals, plants and fungi to meet demand. However, innovation can also focus on reducing wild trade through improved farming as an alternative to wild collecting. For example, there are patents for sturgeon breeding enclosures. Patents also include processes to produce synthetic versions of active ingredients, such as a bear bile substitute made from poultry bile in a lab. Wildlife trade is subject to the same pressures and processes as other commercial sectors. Understanding how and why businesses innovate is key to understanding the future of wildlife markets. Even illegal trade is not based solely in hidden markets. Patents reveal a side of wildlife trade that has not been recognised or incorporated into decision making. Conducting regular scans of patent applications could provide researchers with early warnings of emerging commercial interests that may lead to unsustainable or illegal harvesting. Policymakers and conservationists should use patent data to inform development of regulations and laws to identify businesses with a commercial interest in wildlife and better understand why and how they plan to use wild species. Companies working to reduce the impact of their global supply chains on biodiversity may need to consider the potentially hidden uses of wild species in fertilisers and pesticides. They must also examine ingredients such as squalene, an oil extracted from shark livers for use in sunscreen , cosmetics and personal care products. Unexpected use of wild species in widely available products increases the burden on consumers mindful of their impact on natural resources. Labelling requirements conceal wildlife used upstream of product manufacture. For example, wild-collected wrasse are sometimes used to control lice in farmed salmon pens but this isn’t mentioned on any product labels. The more information that is available on hidden wild harvests, the greater the opportunity there is to reduce pressure on wild species.

We could then pinpoint key moments when patent filing rates shifted and explore when or how commercial interest changed. One exception was a decrease patent applications for products containing pangolins and an increase in patenet applications for patents related to farming patents, for example formula for feeding young pangolins, in 2017.",

        "article_text": "Sk Hasan Ali / Shutterstock The current political turmoil in Bangladesh, which has seen the government collapse in the face of widespread protests, will pose a fresh set of challenges for the country’s economy. One of the most immediate impacts will be a slowdown in economic growth, as instability creates uncertainty and undermines investor confidence . According to government statistics, the country’s average annual growth in GDP over the past decade has been around 6.6%. Moody’s ratings agency predicts that this growth will fall well below 6% for the year ending June 2025. The interim government, which is led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, must facilitate political stability and restore law and order to put the country’s economy back on track. Read more: Bangladesh at a crossroad after Hasina's resignation – here's what could happen next Bangladesh was already facing a series of economic challenges before the recent bout of unrest. These have included a prolonged phase of high inflationary pressure since 2022. The rate of inflation reached a 12-year high of 11.66% in July, with food inflation spiking at a record 14.1%. This situation is set to continue. The restrictions on movement that were imposed during the unrest, as well as the disorder itself, disrupted supply chains and has led to shortages. There is no doubt that high inflationary pressure disproportionately affects low-income households. Supply chains in Bangladesh ground to a halt during the protests. Tanjil.Rahman / Shutterstock Slow growth in job creation and unemployment, especially among educated youths , has also long been an issue in Bangladesh. Around 40% of Bangladeshi citizens aged 15 to 24 are currently classified as not in education, employment or training, which is almost double the global average. Private sector investment in the country, which is a major creator of jobs, has been stagnant for much of the past decade. And the ongoing turmoil will deliver the investment landscape another blow. At the same time, Bangladesh’s macroeconomic situation has been on shaky ground for a while. Its reserves of foreign exchange have declined drastically, from US$48 billion (£36.6 billion) in August 2021 to just over US$18 billion (£13.8 billion) in May 2024. The current level of reserves barely meets the minimum benchmark set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for countries to clear import payments. A prolonged period of instability could cause a further deterioration , as export and remittance earnings slow . These are the two major drivers of growth in Bangladesh, having been responsible for two-thirds of the overall growth in GDP per capita between 2001 and 2020. Restoring the economy The interim government’s main focus will be to lay the groundwork for an orderly transition to more permanent leadership. But it will also be expected to address the country’s pressing economic challenges. The immediate task is to tackle inflation. Economists in Bangladesh and the IMF have accused the central bank of failing to use monetary policy properly in recent years. For instance, interest rates were capped at 9% for lending and 6% for bank deposits between April 2020 and June 2023, despite growing inflationary pressure. The government, which had been led by Sheikh Hasina since 2009, also borrowed heavily from the central bank in an attempt to address its dismal performance in mobilising revenue. However, borrowing from the central bank usually stokes inflationary pressure as it puts more money into circulation. A new governor of the central bank, eminent economist Ahsan H. Mansur, has taken over and expectations are high about the bank fulfilling its due roles. But many of the challenges facing Bangladesh’s economy are structural. In the banking sector , for example, reforms are needed to address issues such as very high default rates on loans, poor governance and inadequate risk management practices. Data from the Bangladesh Bank shows that approximately 11% of loans are subject to late repayment or are not repaid at all – with the actual amount likely to be twice as high . There needs to be better transparency and more regulatory oversight to ensure that banks adopt sound financial practices . The interim government has announced that it will soon form a banking commission to address these issues. Tax revenue collection in Bangladesh is also much lower than it is in other countries with a similar level of development. The new government will need to broaden the tax base , improve tax compliance, and enhance the efficiency of tax collection. These reforms should allow public expenditure to increase. Public spending in Bangladesh has been considerably lower than similar countries over recent years, at around 15% of GDP . This has, in part, been the result of widespread corruption. During Hasina’s 15 years in power, nearly US$150 billion (£115 billion) was siphoned out of the country . US-based thinktank Global Financial Integrity, found that most of the stolen funds came from loans taken from banks, largely by politically influential people and businesses. Hasina’s government faced numerous allegations of corruption. Sk Hasan Ali / Shutterstock And finally, Bangladesh needs to move away from its current reliance on its garment industry. Ready-made garments are by far the biggest export industry in the country, accounting for 85% of all export revenues. But diversifying the export base will be no easy feat. Bangladesh is scheduled to graduate from the UN’s least developed countries list in 2026. As a result, the country will probably no longer benefit from the trade preferences it currently receives in many countries, such as zero duties on its exports. On top of this, the country attracts very little inward foreign investment. To make Bangladeshi businesses a more attractive proposition for investors, the new government must take steps towards liberalising trade, relaxing investment regulations and removing structural barriers like access to finance. But, ultimately, Bangladesh needs a stable government. This will require all political parties and representatives in the country to rally around a reformist agenda.

        "article_text": "Liam and Noel Gallagher have finally announced an Oasis reunion tour, 15 years after they disbanded due to their constant feuds. Definitely Maybe, the album that launched the band, celebrates its 30th birthday on August 29. Branded one of the greatest debut albums of all time by many music critics, what is it that makes it so good? I think it comes down to five core components – relatability, positivity, keeping it simple, catchy lyrics and the perfect frontman. 1. Relatability Described by Noel as “an honest snapshot of working-class lads trying to make it” , Definitely Maybe involved no guitar effects and barely any equipment , but made up for it with loads of attitude, “12 cans of Red Stripe and ambition” . Oasis looked like five ordinary blokes who had been dragged out of the local pub and shoved on stage. And that was a big part of their initial appeal. It felt like if they could make it, then we all had a chance. This appeal was further enhanced when fans realised that the drum parts could be learned by anyone with the most rudimentary drum skills (Live Forever and Supersonic were my favourites to bash out on the battered old school drumkit). And, although Noel’s description of his guitar-playing abilities as “average at fucking best” is a little disingenuous, for those who purchased the Definitely Maybe guitar tab book, his parts were eminently playable. 2. Positivity Definitely Maybe is a definitive statement of working-class values and anti-establishment ideals . But the main takeaway for me is its sheer positivity and lust for life. According to Noel, it is about the glory of being a teenager and was a response to the destructive and morose grunge music that was popular at the time. In fact, the album’s third single, Live Forever (voted the best British song ever in a 2018 NME poll ) was inspired by the Nirvana song I Hate Myself and Want to Die (1993). Live Forever by Oasis from the album Definitely, Maybe. To Noel, the song represented the complete opposite of the optimism he wanted to get across in his own songs. And in Live Forever, despite “not having a pot to piss in” , Noel expresses his gratitude for simply being alive, and for being able to find beauty anywhere ,  even in things that could be painful. 3. Keeping it simple, and loud Spin magazine once described Oasis’s sound as “dense, structured, not particularly groundbreaking rock music” . But Noel was never trying to rewrite the rule book with Definitely Maybe. His writing technique, of taking bits and pieces from rock and roll’s past and reformatting them for a new generation , provided both freshness and familiarity. This allowed him to write catchy, heavyweight sing-along anthems that reached as many people as possible. As he said in a 1994 Guardian interview : “[If] you want to sell 5,000 limited-edition red vinyl seven-inches, that’s fine. Make music for a closet full of people in Bradford somewhere … but it doesn’t mean anything to anyone.” Racking up 86,000 sales in its first week of release , Definitely Maybe certainly shifted more than a closet full. And, thanks to technician Owen Morris, it’s likely that many thousands more people were listening to through neighbouring walls. Definitely Maybe was seriously loud down to a technique called “brick-walling” that Morris claims he invented during the mastering process. This involved pushing the volume to the very limit of what a CD could produce without distorting. This made Definitely Maybe one of the loudest-sounding records of its era and allowed it to capture the kinetic energy of Oasis’s live shows . I’d like to take this opportunity to apologise to my own neighbours for the noise pollution. 4. Lyrics So, with its catchy melodies ( Slide Away was so good that Noel recycled it eight years later as Stop Crying Your Heart Out ) and huge sound, Definitely Maybe was well on its way to grabbing and keeping our attention. But I’d argue that the lyrics are just as important, despite their simplicity and often-nonsensical content leading Noel’s critics to dismiss them as meaningless drivel . What was important to Noel wasn’t that his listeners took a single “correct” meaning from a song, but that they take one at all . Like the classic creative writing mantra “show don’t tell” , in Definitely Maybe, rather than telling us how or what to think, Noel presents us with a series of images and situations that invite us to figure out what they mean to us, which makes us active in the experience rather than passive . In doing this, Noel ensures that even the absurd images that are found in the likes of Shakermaker (“I’ve been driving in my car with my friend Mr. Soft/ Mr. Clean and Mr. Ben are living in my loft”) and Digsy’s Dinner (“your friends will all go green for my lasagna”) become meaningful and connect us still further to the album Rock ‘N’ Roll Star by Oasis from the album Definitely, Maybe. 5. Liam However great its songs, it’s unlikely Definitely Maybe would have had a fraction of its success with a different frontman. In Liam Gallagher, Oasis had one of the most compelling performers the UK has ever produced, someone who embodied the swagger and energy of the songs he was singing. On Definitely Maybe, we see more of a diversity of Liam’s singing style than at any other point in his career. His patented sneer on tracks like Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rock ‘N’ Roll Star is paired with the tenderness of Married With Children where, in the bridge section, his voice takes on a vulnerability he’s never shown since. Upon leaving Oasis in 2009, Noel said he “could not go on working with Liam a day longer” , but has since conceded that much of Oasis’s success was down to Liam’s singing and good looks . A rare understatement of his own importance to the group from Noel, but an even rarer acknowledgement of the role his troublesome brother played in making Oasis one of the biggest bands in the world.

        "article_text": "SpaceX , CC BY-NC-ND The Polaris Dawn mission has been attracting lots of attention because it will feature the first ever spacewalk by commercial space travellers. There are many reasons why this is a landmark mission. But, with its ambition comes a degree of risk. The mission is backed by Elon Musk’s company SpaceX and there are no professional astronauts among the crew. Flying aboard the mission is a businessman, a fighter pilot and two SpaceX employees. The mission represents an emerging parallel track in orbital spaceflight which is privately funded compared to the upcoming government-backed US Artemis missions to return humans to the Moon. The four crew members of Polaris Dawn are currently scheduled to launch in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday August 28. During the five day mission, they will travel further from Earth than any humans have been since the Apollo missions, heading up to 1,400 km in altitude. In addition to the spacewalk, the crew will travel through portions of the Van Allen radiation belts – zones of energetic charged particles around Earth. This will allow them to carry out tests aimed at understanding the effects of space radiation on human health. Other experiments include one related to how the eyes and vision system respond in microgravity. The crew will also test a laser-based communication system in space. This will provide data for future space communications systems that could be used on missions to the Moon and Mars. The spacecraft’s commander is Jared Isaacman, an American businessman who is flying on a commercial SpaceX mission for the second time. The retired US Air force lieutenant colonel Scott Poteet will serve as the mission’s pilot. Sarah Gillis, is a mission specialist, and is the lead space operations engineer at SpaceX. Gillis is scheduled to perform the spacewalk, known formally as an extravehicular activity (EVA), together with Isaacman. Finally, Anna Menon is a mission specialist and medical officer on the flight. Like Gillis, she is a SpaceX employee who leads space operations and is a mission director at the company. The mission will be commanded by businessman Jared Isaacman. SpaceX , CC BY-NC-ND The spacewalk will be somewhat different to the type we’ve become used to seeing from International Space Station (ISS), where two astronauts will usually go outside while the rest of the crew stays inside the pressurised station. The Dragon capsule has a hatch rather than an airlock. This means that the spacecraft’s whole interior will have to be depressurised and exposed to the vacuum of space when Isaacman and Gillis exit through the hatch to carry out their spacewalk 435 miles (700km) above Earth. All four crew members will therefore be receiving their life support through spacesuits while the EVA is underway. The crew are wearing EVA suits designed by SpaceX that will be used for the first time on this flight. These are considerably more streamlined than those used by Nasa astronauts aboard the ISS. The design of the older Nasa suit, called the Extravehicular Mobility Unit , has stayed much the same for more than 40 years. However, the bulkiness of Nasa’s suits is in part because they have a life support system incorporated into a backpack. By contrast, during the spacewalk, Isaacman and Gillis will receive life support to their suits through long tubes called umbilicals which are attached to the capsule. Ambitious objectives The significance of the Polaris Dawn EVA can’t be understated. Spacewalks have been reserved for government-backed space travellers since Alexei Leonov became the first human to step outside a space capsule on the Soviet Voskhod 2 mission in 1965. The first spacewalk by an all-commercial crew is a key moment in the history of spaceflight. The ambitious objectives of this mission, however, do also make it somewhat dangerous. While all the crew members are extremely capable and have been well trained for this mission, there are no professional astronauts aboard to advise. It is also the first spaceflight for three of the four crew members. Having said all this, Polaris Dawn is an inspiring endeavour. It’s common these days to hear criticism of spaceflight along the lines of: “instead of going to space, why don’t rich people give away some of their money to those in need on Earth?” During Inspiration4 , Jared Isaacman’s first spaceflight, aboard a Crew Dragon capsule , the businessman raised more than US$240 million (£181 million) for the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. For this mission, he is planning to replicate that success. The Polaris Dawn website allows internet users to donate to the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital , with the goal of improving the detection and treatment of childhood cancer around the globe. The crew members will also conduct several health-related experiments during the mission, with the aim of advancing medical research. This is the first of three missions in a privately-funded Polaris Program. As more commercial missions take place, the cost of access to orbit will come down. This will help democratise spaceflight, opening it up to those who are not professional astronauts or super-rich. Hopefully, it will also inspire the younger generation to see space not as the final frontier, but as a natural expansion of humans beyond the limits of Earth. The mission will use the Dragon spacecraft named Resilience, which is the vehicle flown in 2020 for the first full mission to launch US astronauts from American soil following the retirement of the Nasa space shuttle a decade earlier. The connection between the achievements of the past and the amazing results of the present is the most intriguing part of the story here. At least that’s how I see it as a child of the Apollo era, and apparently now, as a member of the Artemis generation.

        "article_text": "VesnaArt/Shutterstock For a not insubstantial fee, many private clinics in the UK offer full-body MRI scans to detect disease and abnormalities at the earliest stage. Kim Kardashian and Kate Hudson are fans . (Other celebrity endorsements are available.) So how do these scans work and are they “life saving” , as Kardashian suggests? MRI produces 3D detailed anatomical images of almost every internal structure in the human body, including the organs, bones, muscles and blood vessels. MRI scanners create images of the body using a large magnet and radio waves. Unlike X-rays or CT, it doesn’t rely on ionising radiation, which can very slightly increase the risk of cancer. Prices of full body scans in the UK range from £1,000 to £3,000. While they give a good basic overview of your anatomy, they don’t optimise the view of each organ or system. Any unusual findings would need to be further investigated by specialised MRI scans for things such as the heart and prostate . This is because the machine needs to be adjusted to different parameters to optimise the imaging of different organs and systems. It’s important to note that MRI scans cannot detect most preventable diseases. Heart disease, high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes are responsible for most deaths . MRI scans cannot detect these conditions. They may show some structural changes, but other symptoms will probably have emerged first. Full-body MRI scans may find abnormalities, often referred to as “incidentalomas” because they are just incidental findings, on scans being undertaken for other symptoms. Studies looking at over 16,000 brain MRI scans of volunteers have shown that less than 4% of them contained abnormalities that required further investigation. The kind of things found on brain scans include pituitary abnormalities, such as non-cancerous growths . Disrupted blood flow to the brain (without symptoms) has been detected in 7%, aneurysms in 1.8% and benign tumours in 1.6% of the population . Small clusters of abnormal blood vessels, known as cavernomas, rarely cause symptoms and are seen in about one in 600 people on MRI scans . Those that do cause symptoms are seen in about one in 400,000 people . Another area of the body that often throws up incidental findings is the spine. There is increasing use of MRI in back pain . This can lead to the discovery of incidentalomas such as harmless bone growths and haemangiomas, small growths of blood vessels on or in the spine. Haemangiomas are seen in over 40% of people who receive MRI scans, 99% of which cause no symptoms and don’t need treatment. The 1% who have symptoms, such as pain, numbness or weakness, require surgery to prevent progression towards paralysis. Tarlov cysts , an outpouching around nerves leaving the spinal cord in the sacral region (near the bottom of the spine) are seen in about 4% of the population . For most, there are no symptoms. But those who have symptoms, such as pain and numbness, may need surgery to prevent bone decay or damage to the nerve supply to the legs, pelvic structures and genitals. What about serious findings? A meta-analysis (a study that combines data from many studies) suggests that serious problems that are picked up by chance on MRI scans are 1.4% for the brain, 1.3% for the chest and 1.9% for the abdomen . There is also a risk that these scans give a false positive – things that look like disease but aren’t. Breasts ( up to 97 false positives per 1,000 scans ) and prostate ( 29 per 100 scans ) are particularly susceptible to false positive results. These scans may give some valuable information about what is going on beneath your skin. However, for many people, the reports and terminology used in them are hard to fathom. There is lots of evidence that the average person struggles to understand common medical phrases and often assign meaning opposite to what the doctor intended – for a single diagnosis . Reports resulting from these scans are about the whole body and will contain significantly higher levels of medical information than a single diagnosis – even when everything is normal. Where people pay for these scans without the wherewithal to cover any follow-up medical investigation, it will be already overstretched healthcare systems that have to pick up the fallout and ensure that false positives and benign growths are confirmed as such. These scans offer an opportunity to see what’s going on internally – for those with enough money to afford them – but the likelihood of finding something that needs urgent medical treatment is low. If I had the money to spend on one of these, I’d spend it on a holiday, which would be far better for my health.

        "article_text": "At the end of June, the US Supreme Court upheld an Oregon city’s ban on outdoor camping. The court’s decision means that people experiencing homelessness can be arrested, ticketed and fined for sleeping outside, even when there are no alternatives . The case centred on the city of Grants Pass where, in 2019, a class action lawsuit was brought against the municipal authorities for fining and jailing people who were sheltering outdoors in tents. A judge found that enforcing such a ban would amount to “cruel and unusual punishment”, but this was overturned once it reached the Supreme Court. Estimates from the US suggest that around 653,000 people experience homelessness on any given night. In Canada, the number is around 32,000 . The US rate per capita is about 1.5 times that of Canada, though this varies widely across different cities and regions. Makeshift tent encampments providing basic spaces of shelter and safety have been established across North America, acting as stark visual reminders of growing housing crises. As a result, the question of whether authorities should be allowed to ban people from sleeping in public spaces is rising up the political agenda. Growing homelessness numbers and the appearance of small collections of tents in London , as well as an asylum seeker encampment in Dublin, are bellwethers for how this phenomenon could emerge elsewhere . City authorities enacting bans cite concerns for public and personal safety and the erosion of public access to the pavements and parks on which the camps are set up. But academics and advocates have pointed out that the encampments are often the result of overcrowding in local shelter systems. For many people, there is simply no alternative. Municipal crackdowns can be particularly violent yet remain ineffective. They force people to disperse from a space of relative security with no thought for where they might end up. The “ street sweeps ” cause people to lose their belongings and to disperse across the city, severing connections to social networks and services. This happens again and again, as people set up camp elsewhere. The instability this causes has been shown to increase the risk of infectious disease, substance use overdose, and serious physical and mental health conditions. Courts are now frequently being called upon to mediate and clarify the conditions under which people are allowed to set up shelter. I have been researching these tensions in British Columbia, Canada , where over the past 25 years, 24 sheltering cases have been brought to the courts. As with Grants Pass v Johnson, many of these cases draw on arguments that centre on the human rights of those experiencing homelessness. Historically, courts have overwhelmingly ruled to clear encampments. However, recent developments have signalled a shift in this trend and the growing recognition of a “right to shelter”. The right to shelter This right, newly emerging in British Columbia, builds on a precedent set in the 2009 case Victoria (City) v Adams . The court found that, in cases where there is inadequate indoor shelter available, people should be able to set up shelter outdoors. Since this decision, four subsequent cases have drawn on and built upon this principle. Research shows that being able to shelter in public space can be critical for the dignity and lives of people experiencing homelessness. A 2022 decision meant that people sheltering at the Crab Park encampment in Vancouver could remain in the waterfront park. The relative security of having a permitted location has allowed charities and support networks to set up, providing food and other basics as well as harm-reduction resources such as addiction support, and linking people to local housing support. This decision broadened the scope of the right to shelter, expanding the definition of “inadequate indoor shelter” from solely concerning the number of beds free, to a broader consideration of whether these beds are genuinely available and suitable. Some municipal authorities have sought to bypass , or simply ignore , these decisions. Local residents in Vancouver have argued that the Crab Park encampment stops others from accessing that section of the park and so it should be closed . The city seems to be following a similar logic. By clearing encampments, authorities are testing and revealing the limits of the law as a tool to protect the rights of people experiencing homelessness. Despite this, these “right to shelter” court decisions remain important because they shift our legal understanding of the role of public space. Public spaces are now becoming an important part of the provision of emergency shelter and the housing continuum (the range of housing options available in the city). Society is being forced to radically reconsider what, and who, public space is really for. Researchers have long recognised that a “public” designation does not guarantee open and equal access to space . Throughout history, there have been countless examples of different groups of people being excluded from public space based on racist and discriminatory stereotypes. If we know that public space is never truly public, is it such a leap to recognise that providing shelter for society’s most vulnerable, and frequently most punished, is a legitimate use of public space? If more courts accept this and move in the direction of granting a “right to shelter”, it could rewrite the story of homelessness and housing around the world.

        "article_text": "The African rail ( Rallus caerulescens ) is a handsome bird, with a blueish breast, red legs, eyes and bill, prominent barring on the flanks, chestnut upper parts, and long toes. It also has a characteristic trilling call . This wetland dweller is only found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a concentration in South Africa’s Western Cape province . The species is one of about 140 members worldwide of the Rallidae, the bird family that includes coots, moorhens, gallinules, rails, crakes and flufftails. In southern Africa there are about 15 representatives of the family. African rail. A Oosthuizen / Getty Images In science, a “holotype” is the type specimen upon which the description and name of a new species is based. These are usually preserved or described specimens. The African rail is unusual in this regard: the species holotype is a 1773 watercolour painting by Georg Foster, now housed in the Natural History Museum in London . Foster was an artist on board British explorer Captain James Cook’s second expedition (1772-1775), which aimed to determine if a great southern continent, “ Terra Australis ”, existed. En route to the southern ocean the expedition stopped at the Cape of Good Hope (now Cape Town), where Foster created the painting. The holotype of the African rail, a 1773 watercolour painting by Georg Foster. Natural History Museum Now we believe we’ve found a far earlier representation of the species. We are members of the African Centre for Coastal Palaeoscience at South Africa’s Nelson Mandela University, where we study fossil tracks, traces and images. In a recent research article , we described what we interpret as a painting of an African rail, found on the walls of a rock shelter in the Western Cape, south of the Langeberg range of mountains. At its longest it measures 20cm; it is the largest image in a panel of rock art by a San artist that includes probable images of bees, humans, an aardvark, antelope and plants. While it is not possible to establish the exact age of the rock art, it likely dates back centuries or even thousands of years. If our interpretation is correct it would almost certainly predate Foster’s holotype image. It would also underscore the depth of indigenous knowledge, exemplified by San people who were the original indigenous inhabitants of the region, and who left a remarkable legacy of rock art. The rock painting The San were (and remain) accomplished ornithologists (bird experts). Western explorers have related how the San had names for as many as 68 out of 76 species identified during a single day. The San also considered the thought processes and values of birds to be similar to those of humans, and thought that birds would react to many situations in the same way that humans would. The artist who created this painting has captured the “ giss or jizz ” (an acronym of “general impression of size and shape”) of the African rail, showing its widely spaced feet and forward-angled legs. Whereas most examples of San avian rock art, such as depictions of kingfishers, swifts, vultures or herons, can only be identified to family level, we contend that identification to species level is possible in this case. This is exemplified by the 14 sub-parallel bars on the flanks and under the tail coverts that closely resemble the pattern in the African rail. Such prominent barring does not occur in any other member of the rail family in the region. Half-human, half-bird However, the image does not simply depict an African rail, and this hints at a spiritual dimension to the purpose of the painting. Often San rock art images take the form of therianthropes , which are half-animal, half-human forms. The term “avianthrope” is used to describe images that contain both birdlike and human features. There are at least two examples of this in the African rail image. First is the absence of the bill, which gives the image a more human appearance. Second is the orientation of the toes. The African rail has long toes, three  pointing forward and one pointing backwards. In the San image four or five forward-pointing digits are depicted, imbuing it with human hand-like characteristics. We considered that the absence of the bill might have been due to the disappearance of pigment, and that the pattern and number of the toes might represent an artistic error. But we rejected these notions in favour of the artist deliberately creating what might be mistaken for anomalies and essentially creating a “rail-person”. Why would a San artist wish to create an image of an African rail? We cannot claim to understand the mind of an individual artist and can only speculate. However, we noted in our paper that the rock shelter lies very close to the African rail’s preferred habitat, a wetland with reedbeds. And the bird’s distinctive features and call would have rendered it easily recognisable and memorable. Red was an important colour for the San due to its links to blood. Furthermore, as with some other rails, the African rail can compress itself laterally and become almost two-dimensional. This is the origin of the term “as thin as a rail” and its unusual ability allows the rail to pass easily between vertical reeds and disappear quickly into a reedbed. We suggested that the “rail-person” may have been a conduit for the San to the spirit-world beyond the reedbed. A similar theory has been advanced for avianthropes of swifts or swallows entering a spirit-world behind the rock face . A rich culture and worldview Tragically, the San were relentlessly pursued, persecuted and killed by various colonists, mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were essentially wiped out from many parts of southern Africa. However, the richness of their culture and worldview is now widely recognised. They were among the finest trackers the world has known. San master-trackers from Namibia are now assisting our research team with fossil track recognition, and have recently identified, among other discoveries, fossilised ostrich tracks which would otherwise have been missed. The African rail painting which we have described can take its place as the oldest known example of its kind, and can provide a window into the world of the knowledgeable field ornithologists of a distant past.

Wikimedia Commons Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) was one of the most famous figures of his time, not only in his native Prussia but throughout the world. In addition to being a leading geographer, climatologist, ecologist and oceanographer, he attached great importance to the dissemination of knowledge to society as a whole. Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) – painting by Julius Schrader. Wikimedia commons He devoted much of his life to lecturing and publishing books and articles, with a single-minded commitment that would eventually led him to financial ruin. Humboldt is one of the ten masters whose lives and works I recount in my recent book Grandes comunicadores de la ciencia. De Galileo a Rodríguez de la Fuente (Great Scientific Communicators: From Galileo to Rodrigez de la Fuente) , edited by Comares and Fundación Lilly and released this year. A life of adventure In 1799 Humboldt requested permission from King Charles IV of Spain to explore the Spanish colonies in America. Against all odds, the monarch authorised the trip, apparently impressed by the young man’s knowledge and the arsenal of scientific instruments at his disposal. Before embarking for America, Humboldt travelled through Spain, taking measurements that proved the Iberian Peninsula is essentially a plateau. During his travels he aroused the suspicions of local villagers, who thought he was worshipping the moon when he made his nocturnal observations. Illustration of an Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) Humboldt University of Berlin , CC BY His voyage left the port of A Coruña and took him, together with the French botanist Aimé Bonpland , through lands that today belong to Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Cuba and the United States. It was a true adventure, full of such dangers as a jaguar attack, a rough journey along the Orinoco River that almost ended in shipwreck, and a collapsing ice wall during the ascent of a volcano in the Andes. He also unsuccessfully attempted to summit Chimborazo , but did manage to set a new record by reaching an altitude of 5,610 metres, the highest point known to be reached by a human at the time. A pioneering environmentalist The expedition served to collect scientific data on plants, animals, minerals and climate. Around 60,000 plant species were identified, of which about 1,500 were new to science. Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland by the River Casiquiare in the Amazon (oil painting by Eduard Ender, circa 1850). Wikimedia commons , CC BY Humboldt was an early proponent of ecology, conceiving the universe as a system in which everything is interconnected, and was also the first to highlight the effects of human action on the climate . Analysing the changes in Lake Valencia (in modern-day Venezuela) , he deduced that when forests were destroyed to make way for farmland, springs and rivers dried up. He also noted that every time heavy rains fell on mountain peaks, the rainwater formed channels that washed away loose soil, causing floods. A self-funded author The Basaltic prisms of Santa María Regla, by Alexander von Humboldt, published in the book ‘Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas’. Wikimedia commons After his voyage, Humboldt returned to Europe and devoted himself to sharing his findings. He published 32 volumes of his Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America between 1814 and 1831. He subsequently published five volumes of his magnum opus, Cosmos, between 1845 and 1848, which aimed to be a compendium of all existing knowledge of natural science at the time. Many of these books were printed in large folios, containing more than 1,400 sumptuous artworks by the best illustrators of the time. In their original edition, some of these volumes were so heavy that two people were needed to carry them. These costly publications were paid for by Humboldt himself, eventually leading him to bankruptcy. Reaching the widest possible audience In addition to books, Humboldt’s interest in democratising science led him to use all platforms available to him. He published around 750 articles in the most important newspapers and magazines of his time, including the German paper Allgemeine Zeitung , The Economist, The Times, The New York Times and the Caracas-based Diario de Avisos, among many others. Humboldt was also a gifted speaker. He gave 78 lectures based on his Cosmos writings that, for a time, became the social event of the moment in Berlin. His democratising spirit led him to open them up to anyone who was interested, including women, who at that time were barred from accessing universities. Humboldt himself paid to rent and heat the large hall where these lectures were held, which could accommodate over 1,000 people. His entire oeuvre has an extraordinary literary quality. In his travel diaries he makes it clear that science and poetry are not opposites, but that they can, in fact, complement one another: “Descriptions of nature, I repeat here, can be sharply defined and scientifically precise without being deprived of the invigorating touch of imagination. The poetic must emerge from the sensed connection between the sensual and the intellectual, from the feeling of universal distribution, of mutual limitation and the unity of nature.” Whether through written or spoken language, Humboldt was able to captivate the public, which helped him to increase his popularity and, as a consequence, his influence as a scientist. His life and work demonstrated the importance of public communication in sharing scientific knowledge.

        "article_text": "kos1976/Shutterstock Just three weeks ago, Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock declared interest rate cuts unlikely in the next six months . But if there was any doubt about what’s going to happen to global interest rates, the US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell removed it on Saturday. Before an audience of central bankers from around the world (including the deputy governor of Australia’s Reserve Bank Andrew Hauser), Powell declared the long-awaited US rate cuts were about to begin . “The time has come for policy to adjust,” Powell said, with a refreshing clarity that left no room for ambiguity. “ The direction of travel is clear , and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” Rate cuts by the US Fed and other central banks will create a near-irresistible pressure for Australia’s Reserve Bank to follow. My tip? Australians are likely to get a rate cut as soon as Melbourne Cup Day, Tuesday November 5. Here’s why. What happens in the US will happen in Australia When the US Fed’s rate-setting committee next meets on September 17 and 18, it looks certain to cut the US Federal Funds rate for the first time since it began lifting it in 2022. The US would join the United Kingdom, China, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, Denmark, the European Union, and a host of other jurisdictions in cutting rates – some of them repeatedly – to shore up their economies. Financial markets are pricing in the equivalent of four ordinary-size rate cuts in the US by the end of the year. Given the US Fed has only three meetings left this year, this implies they are expecting at least one cut to be a double. Australia and the US aren’t that different The US story, as Powell told it over the weekend, is also the Australian story. Describing what he called the rise and fall of inflation in his speech, Powell explained inflation took off when consumer spending surged after the end of COVID restrictions. The supply of goods was unable to keep pace at first, and consumers switched their spending to services. Then Russia invaded Ukraine, ramping up energy and food prices and making high inflation a truly “global phenomenon”. What brought inflation down from late 2022 was a return to normal in the supply of goods and food and energy, and restraint in consumer spending brought about by a series of aggressive interest rate hikes. ‘Anchored’ expectations of inflation What has kept inflation falling without (so far) much damage to employment in the US has been surprisingly restrained inflation expectations. If workers’ expectations about future inflation remain “anchored” to a figure that’s low, rather than soaring with actual inflation, they are likely to be modest in their wage demands and be more likely to keep their jobs. But Powell said it had been “far from assured that the inflation anchor would hold”. In Australia – as in the US, the UK, Canada and most of the rest of the world – inflation has trended down since late 2022. So just as in the US, our expectations have remained anchored. Australians expect further falls Each month, the Melbourne Institute surveys Australians about the inflation they expect in the year ahead. On two of the measures, the expectations are ultra-low. One is the so-called weighted mean , which ignores answers of greater than 5% and less than zero (on the grounds they are unrealistic) and averages the rest. It suggests we expect an inflation rate of 2.6% : right in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s target band and not outsized in any way whatsoever. Another measure is called the non-rounded inflation expectation . This excludes round numbers greater than 10 on the theory that if someone gives an answer of 15% they are not serious, but if someone gives an answer of 14.9% they are. This measure suggests an inflation rate of 3.1% : almost exactly at the top of the bank’s 2-3% target band, and again nothing to get alarmed about. Room to cut rates With US inflation well-anchored, Powell said the US Fed can safely cut interest rates to support the labour market, which is beginning to weaken , as ours is here in Australia, although more slowly . Those are the parallels, and they are strong. So the arguments for cutting interest rates in the US apply here as well, even if the timing is different. Australia moved later than the US on the way up and will move later on the way down. And there’s another reason to believe that the cuts about to be unleashed in the US will flow through to cuts here, probably quickly. The Australian dollar jumped after Powell’s speech. When Powell actually cuts rates, the Australian dollar is likely to climb further. This is because cuts in the US make the US a relatively less attractive place to hold money and Australia a relatively more attractive place. Cuts in one country flow through to cuts in another The more the Australian dollar climbs relative to the US dollar, the cheaper the imports that are priced in US dollars become – which is another way of saying the lower Australian inflation becomes. It’s the same for other countries. Merely by cutting their own rates, the US and other countries will be easing inflation in Australia. The more they do it, the more Australian inflation will ease, building up a stronger and stronger case for our Reserve Bank to cut rates. It’s why central banks tend to move rates together (albeit with delays). It’s why on Monday, Australian financial markets were pricing one interest rate cut by Christmas and a total of three by May. Traders don’t believe Australia’s Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock when she said interest rate cuts were unlikely in the coming months . They think what happens overseas will happen here too.

        "article_text": "Ann Hogson/ Shutterstock , CC BY After months of speculation , the federal government has announced what the cap will be for international students in Australia. In 2025, the number of international students starting a course will be set at 270,000. This includes both higher education and vocational education courses. This still requires parliamentary approval. The Senate needs to pass legislation to allow the government to set enforceable enrolment caps. The government has jumped ahead of its legal authority here because the process of recruiting and enrolling international students for next year is already well underway. Education providers need to know how many students they can take. With the caps coming on top of major changes to visa and migration rules for international students – there have been nine over the past year – the cumulative consequences are hard to predict. While caps will force some universities to reject students they would otherwise have enrolled, other universities may not be able to fully use their international student quota. Which students are capped? The government says the overall cap – which it calls a “national planning level” – will bring new student numbers “back to pre-pandemic levels”. However not all student categories are capped. As previously announced , school students, postgraduate research students, some English language students, and students in “non-award courses” (a category that includes exchange students), will not be counted towards the cap. We also have some new exemptions. These include students with Australian government or “key partner” foreign government scholarships, students who are part of “twinning” arrangements (where they do some of their course offshore and then come to Australia), and students from the Pacific and Timor-Leste. In 2025 only new international student commencements will be capped. A student will be considered “new” the first time they start at each education provider. If they start another course at the same provider they will not be counted as new. In 2026 and in later years, the government will have the power to cap all students. Unfortunately, accurate comparisons between the 2025 caps and previous enrolments are not possible using publicly available data. The definition of a “new” student is different and there is no published data on foreign scholarship holders or students who start at offshore campuses before coming to Australia. What does it mean for unis? The government says public universities will have a combined cap of around 145,000 new international students. The caps have been calculated with 2019 pre-pandemic enrolments at each public university as their base. For universities who increased their enrolments of international students between 2019 and 2023 a formula applies, depending on their “international concentration”. This is based on the percentage of their enrolments in Australian campuses who are international students. Universities with low concentrations of international student can have all their growth to 2023 included in their 2025 cap. However universities with concentrations above 37% will get to keep only 50% of their growth. This is likely to affect the more prestigious universities the most. This includes Group of Eight universities , such as the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland and the Australian National University. They will have to cut their commencing student intakes in 2025 compared with 2023 and 2024. Private universities and non-university higher education providers, which are mostly small specialist colleges, will only have around 30,000 new international students between them. What about vocational education? The vocational education sector, which includes TAFEs, will have an overall cap of 95,000 new commencing international students. The government says vocational education providers with a “higher ratio of international students” will receive lower allocations to encourage them to diversify. This will have a significant impact on vocational colleges that primarily serve the international student market. Will the caps be reached? What the government has announced for caps – which allows for some growth since 2019 and a longer list of exemptions – could be seen by some in the public university sector as better than their worst-case scenarios. Despite this, the number of new international students in 2025 could easily be much lower than 270,000. The University of Newcastle is among those regional universities that may see more enrolments. Haireena/Shutterstock , CC BY Migration policy change As I have previously explained , between late 2023 and July 1 2024, the government implemented nine migration changes that made Australia less attractive to international students. A tenth change expected later this year will make permanent migration more difficult for international students. By June 2024 these changes had already severely affected offshore demand for vocational education. Demand for higher education still looked normal as of June 2024, but this was before the non-refundable visa application fee more than doubled to A$1,600. On the positive side, the government says if its capping legislation passes the Senate it will reverse one of the nine changes – a ministerial direction on visa processing priorities. This has seriously disadvantaged less prestigious universities and other education providers through slower visa processing. Blocking student choice While fairer visa processing will help some education providers increase their enrolments, capping popular universities below student demand won’t necessarily help other universities in Australia. Few students who want to attend high-prestige universities or want to live in large cities will go to lower prestige or regional universities instead. They just won’t come to Australia. At the end of 2024 we are likely to find many universities and other education providers have not reached their cap, pushing the total number of new students well below 270,000. The Senate will decide Two days of public hearings for the Senate inquiry into the capping bill raised many concerns about caps. This includes worries the caps will lead to university job cuts . The inquiry will release its report on September 6. Unfortunately for the international education sector, the Coalition supports the idea of education-provider level caps. If the Coalition and Labor can agree on how to set provider caps, this part of the legislation will pass in some form. So the ongoing debate will just be about the detail of caps in 2025 and beyond. Andrew Norton works for the Australian National University, which has said that the caps will reduce its international student enrolments.",

        "article_text": "The Albanese government faces a likely High Court challenge to its installation of an administrator into the construction division of the CFMEU. As thousands of the union’s members held rallies in cities across the country, its former Queensland secretary Michael Ravbar – who’s been dismissed together with almost all other officials – said he would launch a challenge against the legislation passed last week to put the union into administration. An administrator was immediately installed. Ravbar told  the Brisbane rally: “This is going to be the biggest challenge and the biggest fight that we’ve ever had, but we’re all up for it.  You’ve got to get control of our union back.” Ravbar urged  members to vote against Labor at the October state election and next year’s federal election, and attacked Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who he said had “always been anti-union”. The High Court action is likely to argue the Commonwealth lacked the authority to take over a democratically organised union and sack nearly 300 officials, who had not been convicted of any offence. No court was involved in the action. Earlier court proceedings that were underway, brought by the Fair Work Commission’s general manager, are set to be discontinued after the government’s action. The government said late Tuesday it was not aware of any CFMEU challenge. On Tuesday Prime Minister Anthony Albanese denied the claim by the union’s former Victorian secretary John Setka that the government had made “a deal” with the union that there would be no move for an administrator if he resigned his position. Setka claimed on Channel 7 at the weekend that after Nine sent allegations of malfeasance to the union, he had offered to “pull the pin today” so the union would avoid administrators being sent into the Victorian branch. He had conveyed this to the union’s national secretary Zach Smith. He claimed there had been talks between Smith, then Workplace Relations minister Tony Burke and ACTU national secretary Sally McManus. “At twenty to six the call came through, [saying] yes, there’s a deal. Now when you do a deal with the government you expect them to honour it,” Setka said. “I think Tony Burke has betrayed construction workers in Australia.” Nine published a series of devastating allegations of criminal infiltration of the union, bullying and bribery. The government immediately made it clear publicly Setka’s resignation and other actions by the union to try to ward off intervention were not enough. Albanese told a news conference: “Obviously we didn’t make a deal. The evidence is in what’s happened”. The PM said he “not quite sure why people gave [Setka] some more oxygen. But John Setka is someone who will always look for publicity.” Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather, addressing the Brisbane rally, said: “Labor has used these untested allegations to attack an entire union”.

As thousands of the union’s members held rallies in cities across the country, its former Queensland secretary Michael Ravbar – who’s been dismissed together with almost all other officials – said he would launch a challenge against the legislation passed last week to put the union into administration.

        "article_text": "The internet has been buzzing with rumours of a possible Oasis reunion , with the release of a cryptic post on the band’s X account that features only the date of of August 27 2024 at 8am, in the band’s iconic logo font. It was announced today the band will be reuniting for performances throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2025. Oasis were one of the biggest English rock bands in the 1990s and into the 2000s, essential to the Britpop movement , alongside bands such as Blur, Pulp, Supergrass and Suede. England’s answer to the grunge scene coming out of America at the time, Britpop was a brighter take on the rock genre, with catchy tunes and lyrics that often critiqued British culture. Oasis were known for hit singles, with 1995’s Wonderwall perhaps their most enduring. The band has sold more than 70 million records , had 22 top 10 hits in the United Kingdom, and were one of the only Britpop bands to crack the United States. But alongside their music, they were just as well known for drama between the two brothers, lead singer Liam Gallagher and lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. The band haven’t played together since 2009. Like many moments in the band’s history, their last performance – or lack of one – was particularly dramatic. The band was scheduled to play at V Festival, in the English city of Chelmsford, which was cancelled due to Liam’s bout of laryngitis. Later, Noel claimed Liam was actually just hungover, prompting a defamation lawsuit between the brothers that was eventually dropped . Their final show was to be at the 2009 Rock en Seine festival in Paris. But before the band played, they cancelled the performance. Noel then made the infamous post on the band’s website that confirmed the breakup of the group: It’s with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight. People will write and say what they like but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer. The two brothers then pursued other projects – Liam’s band Beady Eye, and Noel’s High-Flying Birds – and there has been a long-running, very public animosity between the pair, who have repeatedly said the band was never getting back together. But fans still held out hope the brothers would find a way to reconcile and reform Oasis. Now, 15 years after they broke up, fans will get the chance to see them perform together again. If you’ve only heard Wonderwall and are curious what the fuss is all about, here are a few Oasis singles (and B-sides) from their discography that Definitely Maybe might make you a fan, in no particular order. Supersonic Supersonic, Oasis’ first single, peaked at 33 on the UK singles chart. Technically only supposed to be a demo and apparently written by Noel in around half an hour, Supersonic shows the band’s ability to rock from the first buzzy guitar slide. Roll With It Roll With It was an important song not just for the band, but for Britpop. Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day in 1995. Dubbed “ the battle of Britpop ” by the press, Oasis lost the number-one spot to Blur’s Country House. But Roll With It is still a really catchy song that combines glam with the melodic and harmonic influence of the Beatles. Don’t Look Back in Anger A UK number-one single, Don’t Look Back in Anger is one of Oasis’ most beautiful songs. They wear their love of the Beatles on their sleeve here with the opening chords sounding like John Lennon’s Imagine and the video clip with their mop tops and coloured glasses. It’s not just a pastiche. Oasis put their own spin on classic 1960s pop, with chiming guitars, a winding chord progression, a classic, melodic guitar solo, and some surprisingly charming lyrics. Whatever Whatever was a stopgap single to tide the band over between albums. It is an overlooked gem, and one of their very best Beatles-esque tunes, with a gorgeous string quartet and a lyric insisting we should all be free to be ourselves. The Masterplan A B-side to Wonderwall – a tough act to follow! – The Masterplan really showed what the band was capable of, both instrumentally and harmonically. The use of dynamics works so well in this song. It starts out very small, and becomes a swell of textures with big horns, lush strings, keyboards, guitars and more. Stop Crying Your Heart Out Stop Crying your Heart Out is a surprisingly sweet ballad about resilience and hope for the future. Oasis lyrics could be abstract, or at other times incredibly simple, succinct and clear. This is an example of the latter. The grain of Liam’s voice and the grandeur of the lush arrangement makes for a beautiful track. Half the World Away Half the World Away was a B-side to Whatever, and is in contrast with the lush arrangement of strings and keys on the A-side. Sung by Noel, the song is quiet, acoustic and surprisingly poignant. Lyla Lyla is a later-era single. It combines the pop catchiness of a love song with psychedelic touches that really work. Perhaps the cleverest moment is the changing of time signature during the chorus – it might make it hard to dance in time, but it really works as a fun musical moment that doesn’t happen often in Oasis songs. Who Feels Love Who Feels Love is Oasis at their dreamy and psychedelic best – a groovy half-time beat, lots of backwards swirling guitars, and a drone that really makes you want to sway. A modern take on 1960s rock. Live Forever The early single Live Forever has become one of Oasis’ most iconic songs. Written in contrast to the grunge and alternative movements in the US at the time,  the song acknowledges the bad times (“Did you ever feel the pain, in the morning rain, as it soaks you to the bone?”), but also has a sense of hope: “We see things they’ll never see – you and I are gonna live forever”.

Perhaps the cleverest moment is the changing of time signature during the chorus – it might make it hard to dance in time, but it really works as a fun musical moment that doesn’t happen often in Oasis songs. The band has sold more than 70 million records , had 22 top 10 hits in the United Kingdom, and were one of the only Britpop bands to crack the United States.",

        "article_text": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were meant to go to the International Space Station (ISS) on a roughly ten-day mission. Instead, they have been “stuck” there since June, as the reliability of their spacecraft – Boeing Starliner – has not met NASA’s strict standards for crewed flight. After two months of testing, NASA has now made the call that Starliner will return to Earth in September without astronauts aboard . This will enable both NASA and Boeing to monitor the craft carefully as it separates from the ISS and makes its way home. Because human life is part of the equation, the data gathered from this flight will inform required changes for Starliner to be certified for crewed flight. As for Wilmore and Williams, they will remain aboard the ISS until February 2025, replacing two of the upcoming Crew 9 astronauts. With the ISS only operating for another 5–6 years, Boeing’s role in the program now remains unclear. Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore (in black t-shirts) on board the ISS. NASA What is Starliner? Boeing has been in partnership with NASA going all the way back to the beginning. From Mariner 10, to the Shuttle program, and the critical Saturn V rocket that took people to the Moon, the aerospace company has been a reliable and innovative player in the space sector. So it’s no surprise that when NASA was looking for a small reusable spacecraft, Boeing’s Starliner design was an easy pick. Over ten years, Starliner has faced issues getting off the ground. Setbacks are normal when developing new technology to meet NASA’s standards. However, software defects caused the first orbital test in 2019 to end without the uncrewed craft docking with the ISS. It was deemed a partial success by Boeing, as the spacecraft was able to make a soft landing back on Earth. But the issues would have ultimately caused the destruction of the vehicle if they had not been caught and corrected. A clear plan to address the issues was laid out, and another uncrewed test planned for 2020. However, the pandemic and even more problems, including a launch cancellation, pushed completion of this milestone to 2022. Boeing Starliner at the Cape Canaveral launch facility in April this year. Kim Shiflett/NASA Back to June 5 2024. After setbacks, mishaps and a launch delay, the Boeing Starliner Crewed Flight test finally launched aboard the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. But as the spacecraft neared the moment of docking with the ISS, some of its thrusters were not performing as expected, and there were leaks in its helium system. Helium gas is critical to push propellant to the thrusters, so this was a concerning development. The spacecraft was ultimately able to dock with the ISS and the astronauts safely disembarked. Starliner launches aboard the Atlas V rocket. Boeing The end of an era When NASA decided to end the Space Shuttle program in 2011 due to the increasing resources required, it became dependent on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to send astronauts to space. While there were many factors that drove NASA to partner with private companies and commercial space organisations, the motivation for the commercial crew program was clear. NASA needed reliable transportation to continue to send astronauts to space from North America at a price it could afford. This led to the Commercial Crew Program , with more than US$8 billion invested to develop, test and certify new transport vehicles. While NASA has always used commercial contractors to build space technology, the agency has then gone on to operate it. What makes the commercial program different is that now companies are being trusted to operate the services as well. Enter SpaceX Dragon and Boeing Starliner. Since 2010, each company has been awarded funding in different rounds to develop crew vehicles. In 2014, the largest amount of funding was split between the two companies, with Boeing receiving almost US$2 billion more than SpaceX. The latter is now about to send their ninth crewed mission to the ISS (ten if you include the private flight), not including the numerous uncrewed resupply missions they have completed. The International Space Station in orbit. NASA Where do we go from here? While the future of Boeing’s Starliner remains unclear, one thing is certain. NASA is going all in to see human spaceflight go further than ever before. Apart from SpaceX, companies like Blue Origin, Axiom Space, Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost and Voyager Space (just to name a few) have all received contracts from NASA to support the Artemis program , which aims to see humans walk on the Moon again by 2026 and to replace the International Space Station in 2030. However, no matter how much money is invested, space is still hard. While NASA continues its ambitions for human space flight, we are still a long way from being an interplanetary species.

        "article_text": "Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, whose final term in office ends on October 20, has presided over ten years of democratic regression in Indonesia. This has been marked by attacks on – and direct interventions in – the Anti-corruption Commission and the Constitutional Court. Both were formerly key government watchdog institutions. It has also involved intimidating and weakening the civil society organisations that helped deliver democratisation to Indonesia after the fall of former dictator Soeharto in 1998. Despite this, Jokowi’s popularity has remained at over 70% . In recent years, supporters have even proposed constitutional amendments to allow him to run for a third term . While these did not go anywhere, Jokowi remains determined to maintain power and influence after he leaves office. This has led to the building of a new alliance with his former rival and the incoming president, Prabowo Subianto, and attempts to create a family political dynasty by helping his sons win office. Jokowi’s son, the new vice president These efforts started earlier this year in the lead-up to Indonesia’s presidential election. Abandoning the party that had backed his rise to power, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), Jokowi threw his weight behind Prabowo by offering up his son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as Prabowo’s vice presidential candidate. To achieve this, Jokowi had to rely on his brother-in-law, Anwar Usman, who was chief justice of the Constitutional Court. In a blatantly nepotistic decision , a majority of the court helped Gibran bypass the 40-year minimum age limit for vice presidential candidates. Usman was removed as chief justice for unethical conduct, but the decision stood.  Prabowo and Gibran won in a landslide. Jokowi and Prabowo’s new alliance, the Advance Indonesia Coalition or KIM, soon became known as KIM-Plus as former political opponents quickly moved to secure a place in the new administration. Jokowi also seems to have secured a new political base to replace PDI-P. In what some have likened to a “ coup ”, Airlangga Hartarto , leader of the second-biggest party, Golkar, was accused of corruption and resigned last week. He was swiftly replaced by a Jokowi loyalist, Bahlil Lahadalia. Another son and ally running for governor In recent weeks, Jokowi’s ambitions to maintain influence have focused on the regional elections on November 27 and the opportunity to install two KIM-Plus candidates in key gubernatorial positions. The first is Jokowi ally Ridwan Kamil, former governor of West Java. Jokowi backed him to become Jakarta’s next governor, anticipating this would prevent the re-election of Anies Baswaden, one of Jokowi’s political enemies and critics. The second is Jokowi’s youngest son, Kaesang Pangarep, who Jokowi was backing to be the next governor of Central Java. Like his brother Gibran, however, the 29-year-old Kaesang faced an age-based roadblock. Kaeseng was barred from running due to an election law that requires gubernatorial candidates to be at least 30. But once again, a favourable (but questionable) judicial decision – this time from the Supreme Court – seemed to clear the path for him. The Supreme Court decided in May that candidates must be 30 at the time of inauguration. This enabled Kaesang to run, given that, if elected, his inauguration would occur after his 30th birthday. The Constitutional Court weighs in And then things suddenly came unstuck. The Constitutional Court, which many feel has become cowed and compliant under Jokowi’s rule, handed down two decisions on August 20 that blew up his plans. In a unanimous decision, the court emphasised the minimum age for gubernatorial candidates applied at the time of nomination as candidate, not the time of inauguration. The court also suggested it might invalidate an election in which an underage candidate ran for office. In another decision, the court drastically reduced the so-called nomination threshold parties require to put forward candidates for gubernatorial elections. Under the current electoral law, a political party – whether itself or in coalition with other parties – needed to have either 20% of seats or 25% of total votes in a provincial parliament to field a candidate for governor. The court reduced this threshold for parties to that of independent candidates. The result is that a party will only need 7.5% of the votes to nominate in Jakarta. This change matters a lot. It will allow the PDI-P, headed by former President Megawati Soekarnoputri, to nominate a candidate for governor of Jakarta to run against Jokowi’s pick, Ridwan. And she had been expected to back Jokowi’s rival, Anies. A proposed law sparks street protests These decisions led to a quick response. The national legislature (DPR), dominated by Jokowi’s coalition and led by a Jokowi loyalist, Deputy Speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, defiantly announced last week it would immediately pass a new electoral law. This would have reversed the effect of the Constitutional Court decisions in two ways: it would reset the nomination threshold to 20% (which would have blocked PDI-P from nominating a candidate against Ridwan) it would set a new age limit of 25 for gubernatorial candidates (which would have enabled Kaesang to run). The legislature planned to do this, even though Constitutional Court decisions are, by law, “final and binding”. This contemptuous treatment of the court and Jokowi’s blatant dynastic ambitions triggered a massive response from civil society, which, like the court, had seemed weakened in recent years. Protesters in Jakarta besieged the DPR, eventually tearing off gates to the legislative complex. Demonstrators holding banners that read “Emergency Warning” and “Democratic Emergency” soon erupted in other cities. There have certainly been bigger demonstrations in the past against the Jokowi administration’s policies, but, critically, these were enough to stop lawmakers from entering the DPR and forming a quorum. Dasco eventually announced the new law would be abandoned (for now). Kaesang then announced he would not run for governor of Central Java. As expected, it was soon reported the PDI-P would nominate a candidate for governor of Jakarta. It still unclear at the time of writing if Megawati will choose Anies or a member of her own party, but either way, Jokowi now can’t be sure his candidate, Ridwan, will win. What happens next? Jokowi has suffered a setback in his efforts to consolidate his power – and public humiliation, as well. But he remains a formidable political force and, when the time is right, he will want to respond to these challenges. A likely target is the Constitutional Court itself. It acted with integrity and courage last week to defy the dominant political elite. But for years, it has been the target of an incremental campaign to undermine its independence through pressure on judges and legislative amendments. The DPR now has before it a bill to amend the Constitutional Court law. It would not be surprising if this bill makes it easier for the government to remove judges, undermining its independence even further. Moreover, while civil society groups rallied so effectively last week to stymie Jokowi’s dynastic ambitions, past experience suggests they are unlikely to maintain the momentum necessary to prevent the bill’s passage. If that happens, last week’s dramatic decisions may well be the court’s last gasp. Tim Lindsey receives funding from the Australian Research Council.

The legislature planned to do this, even though Constitutional Court decisions are, by law, “final and binding”.",

        "article_text": "Is the Albanese government trying to cast Opposition Leader Peter Dutton as Australia’s Donald Trump? And if so, what’s the thinking and why is Treasurer Jim Chalmers in the vanguard of the charge? Delivering the Curtin Oration this week, Chalmers said Dutton was “the most divisive leader of a major political party in Australia’s modern history – and not by accident, by choice”. “He divides deliberately, almost pathologically. This is worse than disappointing, it is dangerous. His divisiveness should be disqualifying.” On any reading, this is extreme language – especially coming from Chalmers. In question time, the treasurer doesn’t mind launching cutting barbs against opponents, but he usually refrains from going over the top. As Chalmers’ attack appears to spray-paint Dutton with a coating of Trumpism, is this the politics of defence from a government feeling embattled, as much as it is the politics of offence? In the past couple of parliamentary weeks, Dutton was criticised by some commentators for concentrating on the issue of visas for Gazans. Surely, the argument ran, he should have been talking about the cost of living, which is what most Australians primarily care about at the moment. Chalmers said in his speech: “Every question in question time last week was about the Middle East, and not one about middle Australia”. But if the Coalition had themed the cost of living in question time, it would actually have given the government more chance to talk about its tax cuts and other budget relief (which, incidentally, it is promoting shamelessly in government-authorised, taxpayer-funded TV advertisements – Labor in opposition once criticised that sort of spending). An important clue to Dutton’s thinking came in Tuesday’s Essential poll, published in the Guardian. It showed that 44%  agreed with the opposition leader’s call for a pause in the intake of Gazans. Just 30% opposed it and  26% were undecided. Whatever one might think of the Dutton stand – which lacked nuance and compassion – it clearly hit a political nerve. On another front, Saturday’s sweeping Country Liberal Party victory in the Northern Territory election doesn’t have direct federal implications, but Dutton would take some heart from it in relation to his own strategy. The new NT government won on law and order, an issue that’s a first cousin to the national security and visa concerns Dutton is seeking to exploit. In casting Dutton as apparently Trumpian, the government might also be noting the current mood change in United States politics. Kamala Harris’ presidential candidacy has swung the emphasis on to unity, positivity and “joy”. It has not just left Trump floundering (at least for the moment), but re-emphasised his divisiveness and the potential risks he poses. At present, two things are happening simultaneously between the government and opposition. There’s more deal-making on substantive policy (notably on the NDIS and aged care) than at any time since the election of the Albanese government. At the same time, the attacks on Dutton are intensifying. Chalmers is working to clinch an agreement with shadow treasurer Angus Taylor on more reform of the Reserve Bank. Meanwhile he is amping up the assault on the opposition leader to number 11. The positive side of Chalmers’s speech was overshadowed by the barrage against Dutton, yet Chalmers is at his best when he is constructive. When he’s in full attack mode, he sounds more than a little like Paul Keating. (From a distance, he even looks like him.) Chalmers has studied, forensically, the man who was treasurer and then PM. His PhD thesis at the Australian National University was titled “Brawler Statesman: Paul Keating and Prime Ministerial Leadership in Australia”. In it Chalmers wrote: “Keating employed numerous strategies in parliament. He sought to differentiate Labor from the Liberals and discredit the Opposition with slick put-downs and by listing the achievements of the Keating (and Hawke) Government. […]  He sought to paint the Liberals and Nationals as out of touch and not up to the task, highlighted internal dissension in the Opposition and pointed out the limited capacity of senior shadow ministers. \"His tone varied from sarcasm to contempt to enthusiasm for new initiatives, but the intensity of the attacks and the disdain for what he saw as an Opposition incapable of leading the country was consistently evident throughout.” It was a style Keating displayed both as treasurer and prime minister. In an interview with The Australian’s Troy Bramston, published last weekend, Keating described how he saw himself: “In politics, I was in the blood and gore business, fundamentally. But with big ideas always running it.” As Anthony Albanese loses the shine he had before and immediately after the 2022 election, and anyway lacks razor sharpness, Chalmers as attack dog may be useful for a government on the back foot. But if this becomes his longer-term image, how good that will be for the man aspiring to be prime minister might be questioned. In government, attack dogs can be popular with the journalists, who love the sport. But often not so much with the public. In 1993 Keating won an unwinnable election as attack dog par excellence but by 1996 it was another story.

        "article_text": "LittlePigPower/Shutterstock Iron deficiency is common and can be debilitating. It mainly affects women. One in three premenopausal women are low in iron compared to just 5% of Australian men. Iron deficiency particularly affects teenage girls, women who do a lot of exercise and those who are pregnant. The body needs iron to make new red blood cells, and to support energy production, the immune system and cognitive function. If you’re low, you may experience a range of symptoms including fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, headache, irregular heartbeat and reduced concentration. If a blood test shows you’re iron deficient, your doctor may recommend you start taking an oral iron supplement. But should you take a tablet or a liquid? With food or not? And when is the best time of day? Here are some tips to help you work out how, when and what iron supplement to take. How do I pick the right iron supplement? The iron in your body is called “elemental iron”. Choosing the right oral supplement and dose will depend on how much elemental iron it has – your doctor will advise exactly how much you need. The sweet spot is between 60-120 mg of elemental iron . Any less and the supplement won’t be effective in topping up your iron levels. Any higher and you risk gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, cramping and stomach pain. Low iron can especially affect people during pregnancy and women who do a lot of sport. Kamil Macniak/Shutterstock In Australia, iron salts are the most common oral supplements because they are cheap, effective and come in different delivery methods (tablets, capsules, liquid formulas). The iron salts you are most likely to find in your local chemist are ferrous sulfate (~20% elemental iron), ferrous gluconate (~12%) and ferrous fumarate (~33%). These formulations all work similarly , so your choice should come down to dose and cost. Many multivitamins may look like an iron supplement, but it’s important to note they usually have too little iron – usually less than 20 mg – to correct an iron deficiency. Should I take tablets or liquid formulas? Iron contained within a tablet is just as well absorbed as iron found in a liquid supplement. Choosing the right one usually comes down to personal preference. The main difference is that liquid formulas tend to contain less iron than tablets. That means you might need to take more of the product to get the right dose, so using a liquid supplement could work out to be more expensive in the long term. What should I eat with my iron supplement? Research has shown you will absorb more of the iron in your supplement if you take it on an empty stomach. But this can cause more gastrointestinal issues, so might not be practical for everyone. If you do take your supplement with meals, it’s important to think about what types of food will boost – rather than limit – iron absorption. For example, taking the supplement alongside vitamin C improves your body’s ability to absorb it. Some supplements already contain vitamin C. Otherwise you could take the supplement along with a glass of orange juice, or other vitamin C-rich foods . Taking your supplement alongside foods rich in vitamin C, like orange juice or kiwifruit, can help your body absorb the iron. Anete Lusina/Pexels On the other hand, tea, coffee and calcium all decrease the body’s ability to absorb iron . So you should try to limit these close to the time you take your supplement. Should I take my supplement in the morning or evening? The best time of day to take your supplement is in the morning. The body can absorb significantly more iron earlier in the day, when concentrations of hepcidin (the main hormone that regulates iron) are at their lowest. Exercise also affects the hormone that regulates iron. That means taking your iron supplement after exercising can limit your ability to absorb it . Taking your supplement in the hours following exercise will mean significantly poorer absorption, especially if you take it between two and five hours after you stop. Our research has shown if you exercise every day, the best time to take your supplement is in the morning before training, or immediately after (within 30 minutes). My supplements are upsetting my stomach. What should I do? If you experience gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhoea or cramps when you take iron supplements, you may want to consider taking your supplement every second day, rather than daily. Taking a supplement every day is still the fastest way to restore your iron levels. But a recent study has shown taking the same total dose can be just as effective when it’s taken on alternate days. For example, taking a supplement every day for three months works as well as every second day for six months. This results in fewer side effects. Oral iron supplements can be a cheap and easy way to correct an iron deficiency. But ensuring you are taking the right product, under the right conditions, is crucial for their success. It’s also important to check your iron levels prior to commencing iron supplementation and do so only under medical advice. In large amounts, iron can be toxic , so you don’t want to be consuming additional iron if your body doesn’t need it. If you think you may be low on iron, talk to your GP to find out your best options.

        "article_text": "The selection of Abigail Bradshaw as the new head of Australia’s cyber spy agency, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), sends a strong message. It confirms the government’s increasing intelligence focus on domestic cybersecurity, both to disrupt foreign influence operations and to promote better protection of our national cyber systems. The ASD is so far succeeding in its monitoring of foreign influence operations, but struggling when it comes to domestic cybersecurity. ASD’s evolving mission The initial remit of the ASD’s predecessor agencies was to operate as an arm of the Department of Defence by collecting intelligence through the interception of international communications (or “signals” in traditional military parlance). The aim was to collect information relevant to the national defence of Australia, its diplomacy and foreign military activities. As early as 2010, however, the distinction between the agency’s foreign and domestic operations started to blur. Today, foreign intelligence collection and support of the armed forces are only two of ASD’s five missions . Domestic cybersecurity is now a chief priority – and a starkly ambitious one at that. As the agency frames it in its strategic objectives : Make Australia the safest place to connect to the online world. Foster national cybersecurity resilience. This is a substantial mission for the ASD, and in large part justifies the massive new spending for the agency announced by the Coalition government in March 2022 under Project Redspice – an additional A$10 billion over ten years. The government described it as the biggest investment plan for the agency in its history. The agency also has two other domestic missions oriented towards threats inside Australia – countering cyber-enabled crime (including terrorist use of the internet) and supporting law enforcement. Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil made clear this new focus on domestic threats during a speech in parliament in June 2023: About a year before our election, our national security agencies informed the Australian people that, for the first time, the biggest national security challenges that we face as a country are espionage and foreign interference. It is largely for this reason that when Labor came into power in 2022, O’Neil, the new home affairs minister, was given a secondary role as a sworn minister for defence. This practice has continued with the ministerial reshuffle last month when Tony Burke was named the new minister for home affairs and cybersecurity – and sworn in as a minister for defence. Bradshaw’s domestic security background Like her predecessors, Rachel Noble and Mike Burgess, Bradshaw brings a more diverse range of domestic security experience outside the defence world than would have been the case for a leader of the ASD a decade or two ago. She previously served as the deputy commander of the Maritime Border Command, deputy coordinator of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, and head of the ASD’s domestically focused Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). She held the role as deputy director of the ASD itself beginning in 2020. Bradshaw’s fellow deputy director appointed to ASD at the time was the government’s former counter-terrorism coordinator, Linda Geddes. These two appointments confirmed the direction the agency was moving, with a very strong emphasis on domestic security. Challenges ahead Recent speeches by Burgess, now director-general of ASIO, confirm that both ASIO and ASD have \nlargely succeeded in their domestic and international monitoring of foreign influence operations in recent years. However, improving our domestic cybersecurity presents a much bigger challenge. Australia is arguably one of the ten safest countries when it comes to cybersecurity. And as a cyber power, the International Institute for Strategic Studies assessed that Australia sits in the same tier as the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Israel, China and Russia – behind the United States, and ahead of Japan and India. On the other hand, there has been a string of sensational cyber breaches in the country since 2022 in which the personal details of millions of Australians have been revealed. This includes the attacks on Medibank Private , Optus and Latitude . Australia is only gradually expanding its cybersecurity workforce and bringing private sector firms and even its own government departments into conformity with modest, mid-level indicators of security readiness. The new investments under Project Redspice will improve this. But Bradshaw will have to be even more enterprising than her predecessors to bring Australia close to being the most cyber-secure country in the world – and the most resilient.

        "article_text": "Shutterstock Death comes at us, unswerving, immense, pressing on us its only gift, infinite absence. Mostly we face away from it. Too often we are faintly reminded of it when we deal with losses of one kind or another. Elizabeth Bishop came at this connection in her own querulously open-hearted way when she began her famous poem of loss with, “The art of losing isn’t hard to master.” And when a 26-year-old Tennyson, confronting the sudden death of his close friend and soon-to-be brother-in-law, wrote , “Break, break, break/On thy cold grey stones, O sea!” his words almost howl at the vast inhuman presence of careless death. But it is one (sometimes profound) thing to see and respond to the immanence of death in the world, and another thing entirely when a person you love, someone you might have raised from childhood or known intimately for decades, suddenly and too early dies. This exposes each one who experiences it to almost unbearable pain and almost complete darkness in the soul. Warwick McFadyen, a journalist and poet, has published two short books, which he calls “tidal charts”, detailing his thoughts, feelings and memories in response to the sudden death of his son , Hamish, who died at the age of 21 in 2019. Review: The Ocean: a meditation, in prose and poetry on grief/The Centre of Zero: poems 2019-2024 – Warwick McFadyen (McFadyen Media) As with Nick Cave’s recent discussions with Sean O’Hagan in the book Faith, Hope and Carnage , there is no escaping the raw and catastrophic despair the loss of a child presses upon a parent. Both Cave and McFadyen take to articulating this experience in directly powerful and honest prose, and also take themselves towards song, lyric and poetry. Some, in their grief will fall into a prolonged silence, while some go to painting, some to dance, some to meditation, or renewed friendships. Almost any discipline we choose can be our negotiation between denial and acceptance, celebration and curse, between ongoing love and love stopped in its tracks. McFadyen’s book, The Ocean , begins with Every day I stare into the abyss, and say good morning. Before sleep, I go to it and say good night, adding, See you in the morning. The abyss sits on a shelf. The Ocean is a series of short prose reflections ordered chronologically according to the time elapsed since his son’s death, the first at two months and the last three years later. He calls his anguish at two months a “monstrous wave” and a dense, black, dead star in his heart. He writes of times spent with his son, their conversations, shared interests, in such a way that as a reader I wished I had known this beautiful young man. Sometimes the writing breaks into poetry or talks about poets who have written about death in ways that carry meaning for McFadyen – Shakespeare, Rilke, TS Eliot. Sometimes there are details of ongoing life, such as his attempts to know how to answer the well-meaning question, “How are you?” At two years, he writes, The here and now of him is like a small boat sailing from  me on an ocean too wide and too deep to hold it back. Sometimes, in the ever-widening parting of the years I think I can hear him say, let go dad, I’m gone. The changes in feelings are tracked in these pieces of writing while the pain and unutterable loss remains in every image he reaches for as a writer working at his craft. The need to keep feeling Nearly two and a half years beyond Hamish’s death McFadyen uncovers a diagnosis for his state of heart in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5): prolonged grief disorder. The diagnosis means doctors can now ask insurance companies to make compensation payments to those suffering this absolutely normal reaction to catastrophic loss. It will also mean that doctors can prescribe medications engineered to relieve such suffering. Naltrexone, a drug for heroin withdrawal, is being tested for this very purpose. McFadyen excoriates this deafness “to the murmurings of the soul”. His act of writing, his marking of time, his feelings expressed here are nothing like an expression of illness, nor themselves a manual for recovery or even a guide to healing. If grief is taken out of the landscape that is left after you have lost someone you love, he asks, “what is left?” “To lament is to love even when the object of that love has gone”, he writes, and somehow this assertion of the need to keep feeling is a much more important reminder than identification of this experience (so common to all of us) as a disorder. The later pages of The Ocean are given to poems in a short-lined free-verse style that swings between specific images of how the loss of Hamish comes at him again and again, with wider poems that take in nature, its cycles, seasons, and moods. It is as though this loss has at first forced these poems from him, then with this gate opened, the poet in him has been let loose to write about nature. McFadyen is a surfer, too, so it is not surprising  he turns to the ocean, to the seasons, to waves and the “lapping of each moment” as images of what he calls “the long leaving”. In the final passage of this fine and honest book, more than three years after the death of Hamish, he tries to lay down his reasons for writing of his loss in this way. For him, “language is the bridge for one soul to cross to another.” He wants, in doing this, to extract the right words, the precise words, while remaining true to the unplanned “tidal surge of giving voice to thoughts in prose and poetry.” Who knew that ashes would weigh the same\nin your arms as when you held him as a baby. Booktopia The companion book to The Ocean, The Centre of Zero , is a series of poems broken into sections under the headings Water, Light, Earth, Voices, Time. The opening section is a paean, a love song, a lament, and a sometimes joyous expression of his passion for the waves, currents, the movement of light on rivers and oceans. Later, within the section on Earth he writes of the plaque prepared for Hamish and “for the sun to kiss”. The poetry is simple, the feelings direct, and within this McFadyen holds the long ache of love for a child who was so vividly on his way into  life that those who loved him cannot stop keeping him alive in their love. These books stand as tributes to that young life lost and as manifestations of grief. They might not be what you want to read now but they might be what you will be grateful to read at a certain time.

The opening section is a paean, a love song, a lament, and a sometimes joyous expression of his passion for the waves, currents, the movement of light on rivers and oceans.",

        "article_text": "Recent earthquakes near Muswellbrook. Geoscience Australia , CC BY On Friday 23 August, a magnitude 4.8 earthquake near Muswellbrook, New South Wales, shook the state. The earthquake caused local damage and Geoscience Australia received more than 3,600 felt reports, including from Sydney and Canberra, up to 360 kilometres away . Since then, there have been numerous aftershocks, including one of magnitude 4.6 at the weekend. The earthquake sequence is directly under the operational Mount Arthur coal mine, so at face value these earthquakes appear to be associated with local mining. But correlation does not imply causation. Let’s take a look at what we know. What causes earthquakes? Earthquakes typically happen when stress builds up in the planet’s crust as a result of tectonic forces. Once sufficient stress has built up, pre-existing weak zones or “faults” in the crust will slide – this is an earthquake. The stress is released as seismic energy waves. Human activities that produce changes to the stress in Earth’s crust can also cause earthquakes. These are called “induced” earthquakes: without human activity, they wouldn’t have occurred. “Triggered” earthquakes happen on existing fault structures, but have been brought forward in time by human activity: they would have happened anyway, but the introduced stress made them happen a little sooner. Human activities that can produce induced and triggered earthquakes include fracking, wastewater injection , the filling of human-made reservoirs, and mining. In open-cut coal mining, removing large volumes of rock from the surface may change the stresses locally and potentially result in earthquakes. At the Mount Arthur Coal mine, earthquake monitoring has been ongoing since the 1990s. While a smaller mine was operational prior to that time, satellite images on Google Earth show a significant expansion – more than double the original mine size – began in 2002. Seismic activity in the region increased from about 2014. This appears to indicate that the crust has been responding to stress changes due to mining at the site. Seismic activity in the Muswellbrook region. Left to right: 1994–2004, 2004–2014, 2014–current. Adam Pascale/ Seismology Research Centre What has been happening recently at Muswellbrook? Since Friday’s magnitude 4.8 earthquake, there have been a further 20 events larger than magnitude 2.5. All of these earthquakes have been within 5km of the surface. This is considered “shallow” and may indicate the quakes happened because the removal of coal at the surface changed the stress in the crust. So, the shallow depth and the possible seismic activity increase since the mine was expanded may indicate these recent Muswellbrook earthquakes were mining-related. But there’s also evidence to suggest otherwise. A recent study indicates that even large open pit mines do not appreciably change the stress along faults in the near-surface (within 5km depth) to trigger moderate-sized earthquakes. Calculations show faults would need to be already tectonically stressed almost to the point of failure for mining to affect the timing of earthquakes. However, shallow induced earthquakes are possible. These generally are very small events – less than magnitude 2 – and most occur within a few hundred metres of the mining. The region had earthquakes before mining Some earthquakes in the Muswellbrook region may be occurring simply because of the local geology. Muswellbrook is on the eastern margin of the Sydney Basin, which holds sediments from 200 million to 300 million years ago. These include the organic matter that turned into the coal now being mined. The eastern margin of this basin is the Hunter-Mooki Fault, a complex fault system that spans more than 400km. Surface geology of the Muswellbrook region, showing the Hunter-Mookie Fault. Rasmus et al., 1969: Singleton 1:250 000 Geological Sheet SI/56-01, 1st Edition North of Muswellbrook, a related fault appears to show evidence of earthquakes in the recent geological past , long before any mining in the area. The southern extent of the Hunter-Mooki Fault is near Newcastle. Australia’s most damaging known earthquake happened here in 1989, claiming 13 lives. It had a magnitude of 5.4. If some segments of this fault system have produced earthquakes previously, it’s feasible other faults along this boundary could produce earthquakes too, without any associated mining. Earthquake clusters are not uncommon in Australia. Between 1886 and 1949, four moderate earthquakes between magnitude 5.3 and 5.6 happened at Dalton-Gunning, NSW, as part of a lengthy seismic sequence. The region still hosts earthquakes to this day. This and many other earthquake sequences are not near mining sites. Overall, the available evidence for the recent earthquakes near Muswellbrook does not allow us to say unequivocally whether they are related to mining. Earthquakes can and do happen anywhere in Australia. While mining can induce seismic activity locally, most of these earthquakes will be minor, and are rarely felt. Tectonic forces are still the main cause of moderate earthquakes in Australia.

        "article_text": "Alice Chaos Antidepressants have helped millions of people worldwide since the 1950s . But have you ever wondered what happens to these drugs once they leave our bodies? We wanted to study the effects of pharmaceutical pollution on freshwater fish. Our new research shows even low levels of the antidepressant fluoxetine – sold under the brand name Prozac, among others – will harm male guppies over time. In laboratory experiments, males exposed to fluoxetine at levels they would likely encounter in the wild suffered wide-ranging consequences. As our reliance on medication grows, so too does the burden we place on natural systems. If we fail to understand the effects of pollution on wildlife, we risk compromising the health of our ecosystems and the services they provide. Male guppies (above) are smaller than females (below) and more sensitive to environmental pollution. Per Harald Olsen, Wikimedia , CC BY Drugs in our waterways When we take our medicine, only some is absorbed by our bodies. Most passes through largely unchanged, in urine. Wastewater treatment plants were not designed to remove these residues. So vast quantities of drugs are released into the environment, along with treated wastewater, worldwide. This means organisms in waterways downstream from wastewater treatment plants are likely to be bathed in a cocktail of human medicines. Over time, exposure to these contaminants can potentially disturb animal behaviour, physiology and reproduction. Of particular concern are drugs such as antidepressants, which have been specifically designed to alter brain chemistry in humans. In recent decades, antidepressants such as Prozac (fluoxetine) have been detected in rivers, lakes and streams across the globe . Fluoxetine has become one of the most common pharmaceuticals found in our waterways worldwide, including here in Australia . Fish on chill pills Despite the obvious differences between humans and fish, we share remarkable similarities . Pharmaceuticals designed for humans can affect fish and other species because they target receptors we have in common. Prozac and other brands of fluoxetine increases levels of serotonin in the brain, which increases feelings of wellbeing and happiness. In fish, serotonin is also involved in reproduction, food intake and growth, stress and multiple behaviours. So it’s not surprising fluoxetine can affect fish . Evidence suggests the effects can be specific to the life stages or even the sex of the fish . What is surprising is most studies focus on short-term exposure, even though drugs such as fluoxetine can be highly persistent in the environment and affect fish over long periods . We collected 3,600 wild guppies ( Poecilia reticulata ) from Alligator Creek in North Queensland. Water samples from the fish collection site showed no contamination with fluoxetine . The guppy collection site. Jack Manera Back at the lab, we exposed 15 successive generations of these fish to fluoxetine over five years. Fish were randomly assigned to one of three levels of exposure, no fluoxetine (control), “low” or “high”. The “low” treatment level represents common surface water concentrations. “High” represents levels typically found in bodies of water heavily dominated by human effluent. Sex in contaminated water We found male guppies exposed to low fluoxetine levels were in poor condition, using a measurement similar to body mass index (BMI) in humans. The modified fin male guppies use to inseminate females (gonopodium) was also larger in these males. Having longer gonopodia helps with mating. So exposure to fluoxetine seemed to trigger a trade-off between physical and reproductive health. When the maintenance of body condition became too costly, the fish put more energy into growing a larger gonopodium. Low levels of fluoxetine also decreased sperm motility. This means the sperm of exposed males were poor swimmers compared to the sperm of unexposed males. Female guppies are capable of mating with multiple males. So sperm from different males can compete within the female to fertilise the eggs. Lower sperm motility can therefore reduce the reproductive success of males exposed to fluoxetine. Strangely, the low-fluoxetine treatment had stronger effects than the high-fluoxetine treatment. But this type of dose-dependent relationship is often found for such drugs and various mechanisms may be at play, such as desensitisation towards higher doses . Under the influence Aside from the effects on reproduction, we also studied how fluoxetine exposure affects the activity and hiding behaviour of guppies. Both behaviours are crucial to survival in the wild. Male guppies exposed to fluoxetine became less capable of adjusting their behaviour in different contexts. They were repeatedly more consistent in their behaviour. In the wild, this can reduce an individual’s ability to respond to environmental changes. For example, consistent behaviour can make a fish an easy target for predators, while unpredictable behaviours can reduce their vulnerability. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence showing similar behavioural disturbances in exposed wildlife. For example, other studies found antidepressants such as fluoxetine can make fish less active . This could disrupt their ability to compete for food and mates. Why this matters Antidepressants can be life-saving for people but pose problems when they find their way into the environment. Our research has uncovered effects on fish that were largely underappreciated and overlooked, until now. The effects of prolonged exposure to such pollutants demands further investigation. This will be crucial if we are to develop effective strategies for protecting and managing sensitive aquatic ecosystems, such as better wastewater treatment processes.

        "article_text": "wisely/Shutterstock When it comes to consumer protections for airline passengers, Australia has long been dragging its feet. The limited protections we do have rely heavily on the general Australian Consumer Law . The “consumer guarantees” provided in this law only require services to be delivered in the arguably vague framework of a “reasonable time”. That might be okay if we’re just getting a sofa delivered from a furniture retailer. The cost of a late delivery is low. But these guarantees were not tailored to the unique impacts delayed or cancelled flights can have on travellers. Australia’s lack of aviation-specific protections has long been a severe pain point for flyers, only heightened by pandemic disruption. The government’s much-awaited Aviation White Paper , released in full on Monday, promised to address this issue. At the heart of the reforms, Australia will get a new aviation ombud scheme, and a new charter of customer rights for passengers. The recognition that new protections are needed is a step in the right direction. But this once-in-a-generation white paper missed the chance to achieve far more, by moving Australia to the style of consumer protection that have now been offered for 20 years in Europe . Why is air travel unique? Airline customers have a reasonable expectation of arriving at their destination, at (or close to) the time published by the airline in its schedule at the time the reservation was paid and ticketed. If this can’t be achieved, they should at least arrive at some amended time that was advised far enough in advance to allow related reservations and bookings to be adjusted. There are no timely substitutes for flying. Seth Jaworski Air travel has to be punctual because it doesn’t have any substitutes. On even a modest deadline, driving from Perth or even Sydney to Melbourne, for example, is not a comparable option. And a passenger’s options to adapt their travel plans diminish as the departure date approaches. In the final days before travel, hotel cancellation deadlines pass and alternative connecting flight options sell out or spike in price. In some cases, travelling to a specific event can become pointless for a passenger if a delay is lengthy enough. Australia is playing catch-up In contrast with Australia, aviation-specific protections have long existed in many other developed economies. In the European Union (EU), for example, regulations make clear that airlines have specific obligations and responsibilities in the event of delays, cancellations and denied boardings. This includes the right to compensation of up to €600 (A$988). These protections and the levels of compensation payable for failure to meet specified requirements for different kinds of flights are comprehensively legislated. Canada has a slightly different approach – smaller regional carriers have different obligations to mainline operators. But as with the European regulation, it imposes an obligation to get the passenger to the ticketed destination, or to refund the ticket if the journey has become pointless. The absence of such legislated protections in Australia means we typically have to rely on the goodwill of the airline when things go wrong. Real action has been delayed The centrepiece proposal of the white paper is to create a new ombud scheme with “the power to direct airlines and airports to provide remedies to consumers and investigate customer complaints about airlines’ and airports’ conduct”. This will replace the existing Airline Customer Advocate . A new charter of customer rights, to be produced by the scheme, will aim to give flyers “greater certainty about what they can expect when flights are cancelled and delayed” and require airlines to be more transparent about their performance. Read more: Airline 'customer rights charter' to specify when cash refunds required The white paper noted the poor on-time performance of Australian carriers. It also pointed out that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission identified problems with consumer protections for air travel in Australia as far back as 2017. But its proposals offer no real quantifiable or enforceable improvements to consumer rights. Despite the well-established models in comparable countries – many of which have followed the EU’s lead – Australians will need to wait for yet another discussion process to be complete before they see what protections may eventually be introduced. Consumer protections should extend to the knock-on effects of missing a flight. DC Studio/Shutterstock The government’s white paper has largely just kicked the can down the road. At a minimum, passengers on Australian carriers deserve the assurances given to those travelling in and from Europe: in the event of a cancellation or long delay, that they will be transported to their destination on an alternative flight as quickly as possible. They should also be given appropriate meals and accommodation until they can make this onward journey, receive compensation for lengthy delays, and have the option to return home with a full refund if their travel has become pointless.

        "article_text": "Dong Nhat Huy/Shutterstock This week, outgoing Senex Energy chief executive Ian Davies made headlines when he warned within a few short years, Australia won’t have enough gas to meet our demand, due largely to government inaction and intervention. This is both true and not true. Australia-wide, there is no shortage of gas. We’re the world’s second largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), after all. Critics see the purported supply crisis as a move by the industry to open up new gas fields. But in gas-dependent Victoria, the risk of shortages is very real. That’s because the state’s offshore gas wells are running out, and governments and industry haven’t acted to boost supplies until renewables can cover the gap. Since 2010, production from offshore gas wells in Victoria has fallen by 70% and there’s not been enough new gas to replace it. The state government has banned fracking. And while New South Wales will soon have a gas import terminal (Australia’s first), Victoria knocked back a similar proposal on environmental grounds three years ago, and another, proposed for Geelong , is yet to secure environmental approval. Victorian leaders will be relieved winter is ending and the gas heaters will be turned off. But the problem will not go away without concerted action. What’s the shape of the problem? Australia’s energy market operator has issued increasingly direct calls for more investment in Victoria’s straining gas system. Early this year, the operator warned: Investment uncertainty in gas supply and infrastructure projects remains high, and many [potential projects] have not materially progressed. Since the late 1960s, Victoria has relied on its wealth of offshore gas in Bass Strait, extracting enough for its own needs and exporting to South Australia and NSW. Its abundance and affordability led to more homes and small businesses taking up gas than in any other Australian jurisdiction. More than two million Victorian homes still use gas . Change is coming slowly – last year, the state used about 177 petajoules of gas, the lowest demand this century. Annual output from Bass Strait’s gas fields is now around 300 petajoules and falling steadily. But this is an annual figure – it’s hard to ramp up production to meet sudden increases in demand. The problem came to a head this cold, still winter. Wind and hydro power production fell. People fired up gas heaters, and gas power plants had to cover more electricity demand. Stored gas rapidly ran low . At winter’s end, demand for gas falls off sharply. But this seasonal problem will soon become continuous as production keeps falling. The state government is belatedly planning to phase out gas. These plans are welcome, but too late to solve the immediate problem. Getting Victoria off gas means 200 households have to quit gas every day for the next 20 years . In 1998, an explosion at the Longford gas plant in Gippsland left households and businesses without gas for weeks. A gas shortage would be less immediate but still bring disruption and financial pain for businesses. What should be done? Australia has a lot of gas, but it is unevenly distributed. Most large current or future gas fields are in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. To send it thousands of kilometres south would require major upgrades to existing pipelines or new, bigger pipelines. Investors have shown limited interest. The NSW import terminal under construction at Port Kembla, near Wollongong, could deliver gas to Victoria via existing pipelines. But so far, energy retailers have not committed to use it, likely because potential seasonal shortfalls are not yet severe enough to cover the cost of its use. That leaves shipping it directly to Victoria from overseas or from northern ports.  It sounds odd for a major producer to import gas – but it could be the cheapest solution. Our major gas buyers – Japan, Korea and China – have built large LNG import terminals, with giant tanks and lots of infrastructure. A Victorian import terminal would look very different, as it would be a temporary measure to ensure gas keeps flowing until demand ceases. A floating storage and regasification unit is a large ship that can turn LNG back into gas and store it until needed. Sanatana/Shutterstock To do it, the terminal operator would build a wharf and lease a special type of ship – a floating storage and regasification unit, able to boil LNG back into gas and store it. While it would cost, say, A$100-200,000 a day to rent, that could still be cheaper than building new pipelines. When demand falls, the operator could stop leasing the ship. Three years ago, AGL’s proposed import terminal in Westernport Bay was knocked back on environmental grounds. Now there are plans for an import terminal in a less ecologically sensitive location in Geelong. Oil refinery owner Viva Energy wants to build a new wharf next to its existing one in Corio Bay, and then hire a regasification unit. Environmentalists have taken aim at this proposal too. If Viva is knocked back, it would leave Victoria dependent on the Port Kembla terminal. A new proposal would see a new wharf built at the Viva Energy oil refinery in Geelong to permit mooring of large regasification ships. Dorothy Chiron/Shutterstock Environmentalists do not like the idea of gas. They point out that burning methane is far from green. Environmentally minded voters are likely one reason why Victoria’s long serving Labor government has struggled to shore up gas supplies. In May, state energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio had to admit Victoria would need new gas supplies . The harsh reality is we must get off gas – but we can’t erase Victoria’s long reliance overnight. Doing nothing means gas shortages will be inevitable, acting as an economic, social, and political disruption to tackling climate change.

        "article_text": "The spotlight is back on speed limits, as the Western Australian government prepares to host a road safety summit in early September. Ahead of the meeting, at least one expert has called for the WA government to lower default speed limits on rural roads in WA to 100 kilometres per hour, down from 110 kilometres per hour. While every other state and territory in Australia has a rural road default speed limit of 100 kilometres per hour, the default limit on rural WA and Northern Territory roads is 110 kilometres per hour. So, would dropping the default limit by just ten kilometres on country roads in WA and NT make a difference? And how might it be enforced? Here’s what the evidence says. Would it make a difference, and how do we know? Theory tells us that the faster the speed at which a vehicle crashes , the more likely it will result in serious or fatal injuries. There is a limit to what the human body can withstand . Now let’s look at what has been found in practice. Research we conducted at the Centre for Automotive Safety Research showed the risk of serious and fatal injury in all impact types reduced from 4.6% at a travel speed of 110 kilometres per hour to 3.3% at 100 kilometres per hour. That’s a reduction of about 28%. For head-on impacts, the risk of serious and fatal injury fell from 20.9% to 12.2% – a 41% reduction. But will reducing speed limits actually reduce the speed at which people travel? In 2019, a group of researchers reviewed studies that reported on 26 changes in average travel speeds due to changes in speed limits. This included results from three Australian studies. The review found cutting the speed limit by ten kilometres per hour may be expected to reduce the average actual travel speed by three kilometres per hour. In other words, even if people didn’t slow down a lot, they still slowed down a bit, which helps reduce risk. And over time, as drivers get used to the new lower speed limit, they may slow down even more . But do crashes actually go down? Yes. Studies from around the world have shown that, generally, when speed limits go down, crashes go down . This is true for both injury crashes and fatal crashes. The same pattern holds true in Australia, too. Australian studies looking at the effect of reductions from 110 kilometres per hour to 100 kilometres per hour found injury crashes were reduced by: 19% in Victoria 27% in South Australia , and 27% in New South Wales . Would a speed limit change really help, given how much rural roads vary in quality anyway? The default rural speed limit applies to all roads outside of towns and cities (except where a different speed limit has been posted). And remember: just because the default rural limit is lowered to 100 kilometres per hour, it doesn’t mean that will be the limit for all roads. Some roads may still have higher or lower speed limits. A lower default speed limit on rural roads makes sense because it would make drivers safer on already poor quality rural roads. Many rural roads are undivided, narrow, have no shoulder, or are unsealed. They may have hazards such as trees close to the edge of the road. Hazards such as livestock, wildlife, heavy vehicles, agricultural vehicles, or mining vehicles are common. For these reasons, many rural roads are better suited to lower speed limits. On the other hand, a high quality road – like a freeway or highway with divided traffic flows, sealed shoulders, dual lanes or passing lanes, few or no intersections, and roadside clear ways or barriers – may be better suited to a higher speed limit. Could a lower default limit on rural roads even be enforced? Setting safer speed limits is just one part of the picture. While the majority of road users obey speed limits, enforcement is necessary. Police already enforce the current speed limits in rural areas, mostly by traffic patrols, and would continue to do so if they are reduced. Technology can also play a part. Authorities often use safety cameras to monitor driver speed and other behaviours throughout Australia. In particular, mobile point-to-point safety cameras (which can be moved to different locations to measure travel speed and enforce limits)  are likely to enhance enforcement in rural areas and have been trialled in Western Australia . Overall, the evidence is clear. Lowering the default rural road speed limit from 110 kilometres per hour to 100 kilometres per hour in WA and NT would be a positive for road safety. It’s a change that could save lives. Sam Doecke receives funding from the South Australian government. He is a member of the Australasian College of Road Safety.

        "article_text": "Jenny Jandt , Author provided What good are wasps? It’s a question we hear all the time. And, let’s face it, wasps are routinely demonised . They interrupt picnics (they love beer and fruit as much as we do). Their sting can be painful or even cause an allergic reaction requiring medical treatment. And a swarm of them flying at you is genuinely terrifying. The beech forests in the northern South Island of New Zealand are home to the world’s highest populations of ground-nesting Vespula wasps, also known as the German or common wasp. So it’s not surprising they get a lot of press, and hardly any of it is positive. But this reputation is not entirely deserved. In fact, some types of wasp have been shown to be useful in crop pest control – something New Zealand’s horticultural industries may benefit from. Wasps in New Zealand Foreign wasps arrived in New Zealand around the middle of the 20th century, after queens stowed away in cargo ships from Europe. The new habitat suited their life cycle , and the wasps thrived. Like honey bees and bumble bees, the two main “social wasp” groups – Polistes (paper wasps), and Vespula (ground-nesting wasps) – aren’t native. But unlike bees, they are active predators of other insects. This means they compete for food with native birds and lizards, and can also affect the populations of some endemic insect populations (especially in beech forests). They may also periodically terrorise managed beehives. Consequently, there are nationwide efforts to eradicate social wasps in New Zealand. But these wasps eat the insects that “bug” us too. Evidence has been mounting for more than 40 years that wasps – particularly Polistes , which are major predators of caterpillars – may be effective at controlling crop pests. Beneficial predators In our recent study in the Midwestern United States, we moved wasp colonies into a large, screened cage containing broccoli plants. We then added caterpillars and measured how the presence of wasps affected pest consumption of the plants. The wasps ate all the caterpillars we set out within three hours. They were clever, too, eventually following us as we put the caterpillars on the crops. We also realised some wasps had worked out how to sneak onto our control plants (from which they were meant to be excluded). We revised our controls and re-ran the study, this time using a different species of Polistes and a different crop, kale. By day six, all caterpillars from our plants were missing. The results were clear. Not only can we move Polistes wasp colonies to a new location, but these paper wasps are active predators of crop pests. When wasps were excluded from the broccoli or kale that caterpillars had been added to, pest damage increased. When wasps were allowed to hunt, the crops prospered. Like Vespula wasps, Polistes can sting if their nest is disturbed. But unlike Vespula , Polistes build small nests under the eaves of buildings. Their nests are relatively easy to remove and relocate to a better spot. By relocating Polistes wasps into these boxes, we can move nests into small areas or distribute around a crop field. The boxes also act as a buffer to reduce the chances of disturbing the nest and being stung. Polistes wasps seek and destroy caterpillar pests on broccoli plants. Pest control potential If you watch wasps long enough, you can observe them carrying pests away from your home garden, local park or farm. So, could Polistes be harnessed as a pest controller in New Zealand? Our research suggests they hold biocontrol potential for garden pests. But more research is needed to determine how effective that might be, and to ensure they are targeting pests and minimising their impact on native species. Ours is also not the first study to highlight the benefits of social wasps. Beyond pest control, wasps are effective flower pollinators and help spread yeasts on grapes that improve wine quality. Wasp venoms are now being harnessed as medicines, including as a possible cancer treatment . Overall, we argue wasps should not be uniformly demonised. They exhibit complex social behaviours to rival anything on Game of Thrones. And they were the original paper manufacturers , turning dry wood, cardboard or paper into pulp with their saliva to create the nest cells where their larvae will grow. Perhaps one day we can harness them as biocontrol agents targeting crop pests, and reduce reliance on pesticides that can negatively affect beneficial insects such as bees. Like other wasp enthusiasts , we’d like to think their ability to help control pests on valuable crops might one day rehabilitate their reputation. When we provide Polistes wasps in the lab with different coloured paper every day, they produced a rainbow nest.

Like honey bees and bumble bees, the two main “social wasp” groups – Polistes (paper wasps), and Vespula (ground-nesting wasps) – aren’t native. Not only can we move Polistes wasp colonies to a new location, but these paper wasps are active predators of crop pests.",

        "article_text": "Ann in the uk/Shutterstock As winter rolls on in Australia, respiratory viruses are everywhere. One of the main culprits is respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which has caused more than 145,000 infections around the country so far this year. Most are in children under five. RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia (both chest infections) in young children. Each year, at least one in 200 children under five are hospitalised with RSV in Australia. Babies under six months , and especially under three months, are at highest risk. RSV infects the airways and lungs , making airway mucus very sticky. Young babies may develop cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing and poor feeding. Research indicates severe RSV infection in infancy may also increase the risk of children developing asthma. So, what is the evidence linking RSV with asthma? And why might this association exist? Association or causation? Asthma is a chronic lung condition which affects 11% of Australians . People with asthma often have difficulty breathing, and experience coughing and wheezing. This is due to their airways becoming narrower temporarily, usually because of triggers (for example, viral infections, dust or pollen). Asthma often starts as wheezing at preschool age. But in some people, it starts in adulthood. When we talk about RSV and asthma it’s important to consider the differences between association and causation. An association exists when two events commonly occur together (for example, smoking and drinking coffee), whereas causation is when we know one can cause the other (for example, smoking and lung cancer). While the association between RSV and asthma is well established, causation has not yet been proven . To prove causation, certain criteria must be met. These include a temporal relationship (in this case, RSV infection needs to come before asthma) and a plausible explanation (biological mechanism). Babies are at highest risk from RSV. Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock Some evidence suggests RSV infections alter the developing airway cells of infants and young children. This can mean the protective or barrier function of the airway lining is altered, predisposing the child to allergen sensitisation – where their immune system produces an antibody to something they encounter, such as grass or dust. Allergen sensitisation is a significant risk factor for asthma, so severe RSV infection may contribute to the development of asthma through sensitisation to common environmental allergens. This represents a possible biological mechanism, but we still need more research to confirm this. Several studies show an association between severe RSV and recurrent wheezing and asthma later in childhood. But which comes first? In one study , children aged under 12 months who developed RSV bronchiolitis were followed for six years. Almost half (48%) were diagnosed with asthma before their seventh birthday. Similarly, in another study , children hospitalised with RSV infection before turning two were more likely to develop asthma by age 18 than those not hospitalised. In contrast, researchers who carried out a twin study concluded the data more likely pointed to reverse causation. That is, it was the children with a predisposition to asthma who were more likely to develop RSV requiring hospitalisation. Asthma often starts at preschool age. Kleber Cordeiro/Shutterstock We could be getting closer to an answer The pendulum may be swinging towards causation. Recent findings from a South African birth cohort study showed severe RSV infections were associated with both recurrent wheeze and later impairment in lung function. An earlier study by this group showed that hospitalisation for any respiratory infection, but especially for RSV, was associated with recurrent respiratory infections and wheezing. Recurrent wheezing and reduced lung function are predictors of future asthma. Another recent study of more than 1,700 children in the United States showed avoiding RSV infection during infancy could prevent up to 15% of childhood asthma. The recent availability of maternal vaccination and monoclonal antibodies to prevent RSV will likely help answer this question once and for all. Earlier this year, nirsevimab (a long-acting monoclonal antibody) was made available to infants and young children through state-based programs in Western Australia , Queensland and New South Wales . Nirsevimab works a bit differently to a vaccine, but is similarly given as an injection. Additionally, the RSV vaccine Abrysvo has this year been registered in Australia for use during pregnancy, to protect the baby once it’s born. It’s available for pregnant women to buy privately with a prescription from their doctor, while South Australia recently announced it would provide Abrysvo to pregnant women for free next year. With these measures, hopefully in the years to come we’ll see a population-level reduction in RSV. If at the same time we see a reduction in asthma, this could finally answer the question of causation. There’s now an RSV vaccine registered for pregnant women. MilanMarkovic78/Shutterstock Protecting kids and communities While the jury may still be out on whether RSV causes asthma, RSV and other viral infections can particularly be a problem for people who have asthma already. For both adults and children with asthma, viral respiratory illnesses can be more severe and trigger a flare-up of their asthma symptoms. RSV is spread via coughing, sneezing and close contact. And there are many other viruses that spread in similar ways. Parents can help keep their kids and others healthy by encouraging children to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, and regularly wash their hands. Ensuring kids stay away from school, childcare or other children when sick helps prevent the spread of many viruses, including RSV. Finally, staying up to date with vaccinations and receiving the flu vaccine annually can make a big difference to our health and to those around us.

Allergen sensitisation is a significant risk factor for asthma, so severe RSV infection may contribute to the development of asthma through sensitisation to common environmental allergens. Recent findings from a South African birth cohort study showed severe RSV infections were associated with both recurrent wheeze and later impairment in lung function.",

        "article_text": "Over the past few weeks, billions of eyes have been glued to the Paris Olympic Games. While we watched these amazing sportspeople with enthusiasm, a cohort of roughly 160 elite Australian athletes were completing their final preparations. This group of athletes has faced a vastly different path to the pinnacle of their competition. They are the Paralympians who will compete in 22 sports at the Paris Paralympic Games. The Australian squad will compete in 17 of those sports and many athletes have overcome significant obstacles to reach Paris. Money matters High-performance funding helps our athletes reach their potential and qualify for the Olympic and Paralympic games. These funds come via the Australian Sports Commission’s dAIS athlete grant scheme , which this year rose by A$17.6 million to address cost of living pressures for athletes. The distribution of funds is typically determined by Australia’s previous medal successes (for Olympians and Paralympians), so some para sports such as blind football, goalball and para-powerlifting currently don’t receive any high-performance funding in Australia. Potentially, this means sports like para-powerlifting (in which Australian athletes have claimed only five silver and one bronze medal since 1984) have less capacity to build medal-winning athletes, creating a continuing negative feedback loop. Ironically, there are 20 gold medals up for grabs in this sport (ten for males and females, respectively) in Paris, considerably more than the number available in other sports for a single classification. The federal government has committed A$489 million during the next two years to high-performance athlete development. However, Paralympic athletes will receive only a small portion of this – with $54.9 million in additional funding allocated to our Paralympic athletes in preparation for the Los Angeles 2028 and Brisbane 2032 games. This funding is slated for better classification opportunities, improving training environments, specialised coaching and performance support. But it is not yet clear whether this funding will help to support the additional costs of the specialist equipment such as wheelchairs and high-performance prosthetics that are required by many para-athletes. Equipment costs are significant. An entry level, an aluminium racing wheelchair costs $8,500, while a carbon fibre racing wheelchair costs around $18,000. At more than twice the cost, the performance benefits are significant. A carbon wheelchair is approximately 4-6% faster than an aluminium or carbon-aluminium racing wheelchair over marathon distance, equating to an advantage of roughly 4-6 minutes. Similarly, running blade prostheses can cost anywhere from $13,000 (per leg) to more than $50,000 . Like wheelchairs, they need to be refitted or remade as an athlete’s body changes. The costs of re-fitting, updating and maintaining prostheses can be prohibitive for some athletes. Australian para triathlete Brant Garvey reports he spends $20,000 per year for maintenance and updates on each of his cycling and running prosthetics. Classification is critical for parasports. Accessibility and legacy at the Paralympics The Paralympic Games were first held in Rome in 1960. From the Mexico City games in 1968 until LA in 1984, they were held in different locations. Too often, the Paralympics are viewed as a “ side show to the Olympics ”. In fact, at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympics, the level of accessibility at the venues left a lot to be desired . Fortunately, the Sydney 2000 Olympics and Paralympics set the standard for future games by delivering a legacy of accessible infrastructure and improved disability awareness. The Beijing Paralympics (2008) followed the example of Sydney and invested more than $204 million to make roads, buildings and facilities more accessible. The London 2012 games transformed attitudes toward people with disabilities . This in turn drove greater employment outcomes, resulting in more than one million people with disabilities gaining employment. Kate Grey, British Paralympic swimmer and TV broadcaster said: They really changed the way people covered and spoke about disability. They just made disability feel part of a community rather than isolated from a community. Unequal opportunities Australian Olympic athletes were eligible for a $20,000 award for a gold medal performance at the Paris games through the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) Medal Incentive Funding ($15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze). However, before the Tokyo 2020 games, Paralympians did not receive the same financial incentives and support when achieving success. In more encouraging news, the Australian Government recently announced Australia’s Paralympians will receive up to $20,000 for bringing home a medal in Paris. This funding is in addition to the $54.9 million announced in the federal budget and means Australian Paralympic athletes will receive the same reward for medal-winning performances as their Olympic counterparts. Some swimmers and rowers are also fortunate to be supported by the Patron’s Medal Achievement Fund supported by Gina Rinehart. Australian Paralympian and gold medallist from Tokyo 2020 Rowan Crothers has been outspoken in the need for greater support of para athletes. In particular, Crothers has stated that while children with a disability are often told they can achieve anything they put their mind to, the reality is they’re often not given the opportunities to do so. It takes a team to succeed The success of our Paralympic athletes is also intertwined with the fate of high-performance staff working in state and national institutes of sport or within sporting bodies (such as Swimming Australia or Athletics Australia). These staff typically work with fixed-term contracts averaging 2.4 years , splitting their time (unequally) between para athletes and their Olympic counterparts, resulting in a lack of job certainty, high turnover of staff and a lack of consistency for athletes. With eight years until Brisbane’s 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games , there is a window of opportunity to invest in high-performance professionals to ensure the longevity of the current and future workforce through increased funding and job security. Funding allocation should also support coaches and support staff to improve their understanding of disabilities within a high-performance context. Should such investments be made (in addition to those announced by the federal government in June ) Australian athletes in sports like para-powerlifting, goal ball, wheelchair fencing and blind football may just find themselves not only competing at Brisbane 2032, but standing atop the dais adding more gold to the medal count for our nation.

        "article_text": "By José Luiz Bernardes Ribeiro, CC BY-SA 4.0. , CC BY-SA He lived and died more than 2,000 years ago but Hannibal is remembered as one of history’s most formidable military commanders and as “ Rome’s greatest enemy ”. His daring crossing of the Alps, with an army that included war elephants, shines as evidence to his tactical brilliance. The Carthaginian general’s innovative military strategies in his struggle against Rome give us a glimpse into why his fame endures. An early hostility toward Rome Hannibal Barca was born in 247 BCE in Carthage, an ancient city in Northern Africa, in what is now Tunisia. His father is credited with instilling in Hannibal a hostility towards Rome, a deep-seated drive that would shape much of his military career . Hannibal’s leadership qualities and the understanding of military tactics were honed through his experiences in the Carthaginian army. Hannibal first came into prominence in 219 BCE when the Carthaginian army under his command attacked the city of Saguntum (in modern Spain), triggering the Second Punic War with Rome. Then came his cunning stratagem that brought his army into Italy all the way from Spain. Hannibal led his troops through the Alps in 218 BCE, catching the Romans off guard. What’s more, he brought a contingent of war elephants ready for battle . Hannibal forced Rome to rethink its military strategies. Gilmanshin/Shutterstock These elephants were trained to instil fear in the enemy during combat. In the series of battles with the Romans, Hannibal proved he was capable of undertaking seemingly impossible feats to achieve strategic advantages. In the Battle of the Trebia (218 BCE) Hannibal lured the Romans into an ambush on the Trebia River . More victories soon followed. In both the Battle of Lake Trasimene and the Battle of Cannae Hannibal’s army inflicted devastating casualties on the significantly larger Roman forces. Hannibal’s threat to Rome stemmed from his innovative tactics, psychological warfare, and his ability to exploit Roman leadership’s overconfidence , their rigid adherence to established war tactics, and their initial tendency to underestimate the power and speed of Hannibal’s cavalry. Hannibal forced Rome to rethink its military strategies and adapt in ways that would ultimately shape the future of the Roman Empire . Master of strategy Hannibal’s tactical acumen was unparalleled. He consistently outmanoeuvred Roman armies, employing strategies that took advantage of the terrain and the element of surprise. His victory at the Battle of Cannae (216 BCE) is illustrative of his tactical genius. By executing a double envelopment manoeuvre, Hannibal managed to encircle and annihilate the Romans. Hannibal’s clever use of the cavalry allowed him to outflank the Roman infantry. A year later, he adapted his strategy to a different terrain and used the fog at the Battle of Lake Trasimene to conceal his troops. The effect was a devastating ambush of the Romans. The news of massive casualties delivered a profound psychological blow to Rome. Psychological warfare Hannibal understood the power of psychological warfare. He knew fear undermined the confidence of Roman soldiers and their leaders . The phrase “Hannibal is at the gates” became a Roman proverb, reflecting the pervasive horror he instilled in his opponents. Hannibal’s use of psychological strategies extended to his own troops as well. To maintain high morale and discipline he ensured his soldiers were well fed and shared in their hardships, sleeping on the ground wrapped in a blanket. His leadership proved inspirational. Exploiting Roman weaknesses Hannibal was adept at identifying the weaknesses in Roman military and political structures. The Roman practice of alternating command between two consuls proved to be a vulnerability that Hannibal exploited. On several occasions, he timed his attacks to coincide with the consulship of less experienced in command, leading to disastrous defeats for Rome. Hannibal employed spies and gathered intelligence paid for by silver from Carthaginian-controlled mines in Spain. The information allowed him to anticipate Roman movements and counter their strategies. Hannibal’s campaigns had lasting effects on Rome. His prolonged presence in Italy, despite never capturing Rome itself, forced the Romans to adapt their military strategies and organisation of their armies. The Roman military became more flexible and began to place greater emphasis on cavalry and intelligence gathering. They learned from the very tactics that had caused them so much trouble. This led to Rome’s eventual victory in the Second Punic War. Hannibal’s legacy Hannibal’s legacy extends beyond his immediate impact on Rome. His military strategies and tactics continue to be studied in military academies around the world. His ability to conduct successful campaigns with limited resources and his innovative use of terrain and psychological warfare remain relevant for military leaders today. Commanders such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon, and George S. Patton drew inspiration from Hannibal’s methods, demonstrating the timeless nature of his military genius. An engraving by Dutch artist Cornelis Cort depicts the battle between Scipio and Hannibal at Zama. The Metropolitan Museum Hannibal’s downfall Despite his victories against the Romans, Hannibal did not conquer the city of Rome, allowing the Romans to regroup. His position was weakened because his troops lacked reinforcements and supplies from Carthage. When the Romans adopted a strategy of attrition, avoiding large-scale battles with the Carthaginian general, Hannibal’s army was cut off from supply lines. At the Battle of Zama in modern-day Tunisia (in 202 BCE) Hannibal was defeated by the young Roman general Scipio Africanus . Scipio used Hannibal’s own tactics against him, marking the end of the Second Punic War . Hannibal’s career never recovered. Hannibal took his own life in 183 BCE to avoid capture by the Romans. A long legacy Hannibal remains a towering figure in military history, not only for his bold campaigns and tactical brilliance but also for his ability to challenge and adapt to the formidable Roman war machine . His fame as a master strategist continues to captivate and inspire today.

        "article_text": "Eating healthy, fresh meals together is no longer the norm in today's society. (Shutterstock) The promise of a long, healthy, happy existence living an active, community-based lifestyle under warm, sunny skies may be within reach. In fact, it could be on your table. The Mediterranean diet has been included on UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list since 2010 . Not only does the diet have guaranteed cultural value, it is also a powerful strategic tool for promoting food products such as olive oil. Often cited for its health benefits , the Mediterranean diet was first described in a 1953 book about Crete . At the time, people were amazed at the low incidence of cardiovascular disease among the inhabitants of this Greek island, compared with northern Europeans. Among other things, this olive oil-based diet encourages the consumption of fresh foods, seasonal fruit and vegetables and whole grains . It embodies the essence of the Mediterranean lifestyle, according to the UNESCO definition: The Mediterranean diet involves a set of skills, knowledge, rituals, symbols and traditions concerning crops, harvesting, fishing, animal husbandry, conservation, processing, cooking, and particularly the sharing and consumption of food. Eating together is the foundation of the cultural identity and continuity of communities throughout the Mediterranean Basin. It is a moment of social exchange and communication, an affirmation and renewal of family, group or community identity. Olive oil is at the heart of the Mediterranean diet. (Shutterstock) But beyond its impact on our health, what does the Mediterranean diet say about us as a society? Could it be the symptom of something? As a postdoctoral researcher at UQAM’s École des sciences de la gestion, my research lies at the intersection of heritage and tourism studies, food and mental health. In 2021, I carried out field research in Cilento (Italy), Soria (Spain) and Marseille (France), where I looked at the inhabitants’ attachment to the Mediterranean diet. I listened to their stories and tried to understand the local and social dynamics at play in the Mediterranean diet concept. Mirroring a deep societal crisis The concept of the Mediterranean diet refers to a lifestyle that strengthens social relationships and is good for your health. It sounds simple and coherent. However, the society in which we live turns the work of meeting these basic needs into something more complex. The health and social dimensions of the Mediterranean diet are seen as extremely desirable because they represent a balance that is lacking in globalized societies. Claude Fischler , a sociologist of human nutrition, describes the multidimensional crisis of the food system in modern societies. In his view, there is a psychopathology of daily eating underway. This is characterized by “appetite disturbances, bulimic attacks, anxious or compulsive snacking, etc.” Just think of the consumption of ultra-processed foods or ready-made and frozen meals, eaten on their own in front of the TV in the evening or in front of the computer during lunch break. A meal at the O Vicolo ‘E L'Alleria, in Battipaglia, Italy. Eating together is the foundation of the cultural identity and continuity of communities in the Mediterranean basin. (Author provided) In this psychopathological perspective on food, which also mirrors a societal crisis, mechanisms for cultural (and in this case, food) reactivation are appearing. The rush to the Mediterranean diet is a reflection of this societal crisis, because it is the opposite of our way of life. With its inclusion on the UNESCO list, the Mediterranean diet has thus become a prestigious “monument” of Mediterranean culinary art. This food culture has been mythologized and made a part of our heritage after undergoing an irreversible process of erosion of food production and consumption systems in the Mediterranean area. ‘Gastronativism’: Politics on the plate The food arena is one of the best places to express the anxieties and fears of contemporary life. Fabio Parasecoli , a researcher in food studies, describes the anxieties caused by globalization as gastronativism , “the ideological use of food in politics to advance ideas about who belongs to a community (however defined) and who doesn’t.” So gastronativism represents a political tool that provides “a sense of rootedness, comfort and security” in the face of perceived collapse (climate change, wars, pandemics, globalization). The Mediterranean diet is part of this gastronativist approach, standing for a lifestyle that can be adopted. Different meanings of the Mediterranean diet We often hear about the Mediterranean diet from institutions and academics. What we don’t hear much about are the views of the communities that practise this way of life. My field research in 2021 aimed to understand the different ways in which the Mediterranean diet is defined, described, understood and lived, depending on the community. The Mediterranean diet involves a set of skills, knowledge and rituals that relate in particular to cultivation, harvesting and picking. (Shutterstock) In Cilento, the Mediterranean diet is synonymous with “lifestyle.” It’s part of local identity and a reference to the wider socio-cultural sphere (“our lifestyle,” the locals say). In Soria, it embodies a “nutritional model” and in the domain of health: the adjectives most commonly used to describe it are “healthy,” “beneficial,” and “health-conscious.” In Marseille, the term “diet” conjures up images of fasting, deprivation and abstinence, while the term “Mediterranean” refers to organic, seasonal and healthy food. The reference here is more to the food industry. A sociocultural seismograph Whether understood as a nutritional model, a way of life or an example of intangible heritage, the Mediterranean diet represents a way out of a system (societal, food, economic, environmental) in crisis and in constant search of reference points. Seismographs are instruments that record and measure earthquakes . Like a “sociocultural seismograph,” the Mediterranean diet enables us to capture the vibrations, i.e. the changes taking place in contemporary society with which cultural (and dietary) practices must contend.

        "article_text": "Feeling a sense of uncertainty about belonging is most pronounced for students during times of transition, like when they enter university. This can be all the harder for students who are the first generation in their families to attend university — and students who face socio-economic barriers to post-secondary education. When a student’s sense of belonging improves, they not only become more academically competent but also experience protective benefits for their mental health. More critically, a sense of belonging might have a long-lasting effect on post-secondary students’ persistence and engagement in their studies. As such, it is important that post-secondary institutions undertake concerted, sustained and targeted efforts to create a sense of belonging. One way that institutions can achieve this is to make campuses more welcoming for children within communities, a place that is familiar. This approach may encourage children to envision university as a place where they belong — and a future path for them. At MacEwan University in Edmonton, we established a StoryWalk for children and families where they follow pages of a storybook posted sequentially along a path on campus. The activity is designed to invite families for a fun and cost-free extra-curricular activity to plant the seeds of belonging on a campus from a young age while supporting children’s early literacy. University’s community engagement StoryWalk was developed in 2007 in Vermont in the United States, in partnership with the Kellogg-Hubbard Library . Similar activities are now taking place around the world. Bringing StoryWalk to a downtown university campus allows the university to engage students, families and children in an innovative way. Books on the StoryWalk at MacEwan focus mainly on community building and being stronger together. Initial books — including Walking Together by Elder Albert D. Marshall and Louise Zimanyi and Be a Good Ancestor by Leona Prince and Gabrielle Prince — highlight Indigenous ways of knowing and building a community. Read more: How Two-Eyed Seeing, 'Etuaptmumk,' is changing outdoor play in early childhood education We have also programmed Every Child a Song: A Celebration of Children’s Rights by Nicola Davies. Our intention is to rotate book selections while striving to reflect aspects of social, cultural and economic diversity relevant to Edmonton in book choices. StoryWalk at MacEwan collaborates with organizations and schools that intentionally support families to build their capacity to be successful parents raising healthy children. The project has partnered with local not-for-profit organizations like Terra Centre and Bent Arrow Traditional Healing Society that empowers families and young children. We plan to expand our circle of collaborators gradually. While at the university, families can also participate in other free activities. \nStoryWalk at MacEwan collaborated with Heather Fitzsimmons Frey , who researches the arts and cultural sector and young people, and her work with Elm Tree Theatre . As part of this collaboration, we offered a free 60-minute theatre experience for children and families. Families are also invited for ongoing supplementary activities in the kihêw waciston Indigenous Centre . Importance of early learning Following a StoryWalk pathway with adults allows children to learn new words, describe things and events and tell stories as they walk together. The physical movement while engaging with a story helps children understand story sequences — how stories have distinct narrative components. Hearing and playing with sounds and letters can enhance children’s abilities to notice and work with the specific sounds (phonemes) in spoken words. In addition, strengthening children’s self-regulation and attention can positively impact academic outcomes. The accompanying activities, including reading aloud , are a playful means for children to develop positive attitudes towards reading , and develop early literacy skills. These include building their vocabulary and gaining expressive language. Family engagement is another critical component of the StoryWalk. Doing things together as a family builds values, traditions and rituals that keep children connected to important people and places in their lives. These are some of the ways the walk provides an opportunity for parents, educators and other significant adults to be with children, reinforcing the importance of a person’s positive connections as they navigate an educational journey. Extending a welcome Yet, inviting early and elementary learners for a few visits to a post-secondary institution is not enough in itself for concretely fostering belonging for any students, particularly for first-generation or marginalized students. Formal and informal mentorship opportunities between current and prospective students can also help extend the welcoming environment beyond initial interactions, offering sustained support and guidance. We hope StoryWalk at MacEwan can be one meaningful way to enhance the educational landscape for young children — while also fostering a sense of belonging and possibility within higher education. We are grateful to the City of Edmonton for their support through the Downtown Vibrancy Fund in establishing StoryWalk at MacEwan.

        "article_text": "Janice Lord , CC BY-SA Mistletoes are the stuff of myth and legend , vilified for providing the arrow that shot Norse god Balder, but venerated in Celtic and Roman mythology as protection against dark forces. It is no wonder – mistletoes are unlike any other plant. All species in the mistletoe family, Loranthaceae, are parasites. The bird-dispersed seeds stick to branches with a special glue and tap into the host tree’s water-conducting vessels (xylem) to access nutrients from the sap. Mistletoes are called hemi-parasites because they still photosynthesise to produce their own carbohydrates. Most are evergreen, remaining leafy in winter even when their deciduous host trees lose their leaves. This feat is possible because they can continue to draw sap by capillary action, even when the host tree is dormant. Mistletoes are keystone species This ability to remain leafy year round is one reason mistletoes are increasingly called keystone species – they play a key role in maintaining ecosystem function, just as a keystone at the top of a masonry arch holds the whole structure in place. Mistletoe fruits, as well as the flowers of many species, feed birds. The shelter they provide could moderate the impacts of climate change on bird populations. Our new study shows mistletoes also provide a critically important winter refuge for foliage-dwelling arthropods, especially when they grow in non-native deciduous trees which now dominate many landscapes in New Zealand. Arthropods – which include insects, arachnids, crustaceans and myriapods – account for most species on the planet. They are not only an important food source for other animals but are crucial to maintaining ecosystems globally, with ecological contributions from pollination to the breakdown of organic matter. Winter refuge All of New Zealand’s six species of leafy mistletoes are native. In te reo Māori, they are known as pirita, pikirangi or roeroe. One is extinct and four are considered at risk, mainly due to habitat loss and damage from possums. The green mistletoe grows on both evergreen (here on a coprosma) and deciduous trees. Janice Lord , CC BY-SA All New Zealand mistletoes are evergreen, as are almost all native trees. But deforestation and the widespread planting of non-native deciduous trees in urban and agricultural areas has drastically altered the types of host trees available for native mistletoes and native arthropods. The green mistletoe Ileostylus micranthus is the most common throughout New Zealand because it is able to parasitise a wide range of hosts, including non-native deciduous trees. Our study examined the arthropod communities on green mistletoes parasitising evergreen and deciduous host trees. The idea was specifically to see whether the host type (evergreen vs deciduous) and season (summer vs winter) affect the proportion of arthropods found on mistletoes themselves, compared with their host trees. We found mistletoes harbour significantly more native arthropods overall than the host trees they parasitise. But most importantly, they shelter significantly more arthropods in winter when growing on deciduous hosts, suggesting they are acting as habitat refuges during the colder months. Tangle-web spiders are often found in mistletoes on agricultural land. James Crofts-Bennett , CC BY-SA The benefits of leafy mistletoes in winter may be that they shelter arthropods from weather extremes and hungry birds. They may also provide a more humid microclimate due to the “wasteful” water usage mistletoes engage in to draw sap from the host. Humidity is important to small arthropods. They are vulnerable to desiccation as they have a much higher surface-to-volume ratio than vertebrates and many have external respiratory systems. Relocating to a humid refuge is a common way for arthropods to avoid desiccation . Cherish, don’t chop! One of the issues we faced was that several mistletoes we sampled in summer were deliberately cut off between seasons and could not be resampled in winter. Even mistletoes on native trees were removed from council-managed areas during our research despite our permission to study them. Other research on the endangered white mistletoe, Tupeia antarctica ,  was also disrupted. A tree branch that had been banded, with council permission, to stop possums destroying one of the rare mistletoes, was completely removed by council contractors. This was all the more distressing as the at-risk endemic moth Zelleria sphenota was plentiful on that particular mistletoe. It’s a myth that mistletoes kill trees. The effect on a healthy tree in a healthy forest ecosystem is negligible (although they can have an impact if the tree is isolated or stressed). Isolated trees can become burdened with a large number of mistletoes because there are few other trees around for birds to perch on. But the removal of mistletoes can reduce bird species richness by more than 30% . Instead of blaming and removing the mistletoe we could do better by planting more trees. Perhaps it is also time we moved away from a gardening attitude of absolute control when it comes to mistletoes. We could look to the example of Tāne Mahuta, Māori atua of the forests. When Tāne made the forests he made the mistletoe last. He saw his youngest child was small and weak, so he lifted the mistletoe from the forest floor and placed it in the arms of its larger siblings.

But deforestation and the widespread planting of non-native deciduous trees in urban and agricultural areas has drastically altered the types of host trees available for native mistletoes and native arthropods. The green mistletoe Ileostylus micranthus is the most common throughout New Zealand because it is able to parasitise a wide range of hosts, including non-native deciduous trees.",

        "article_text": "Pixel-Shot/Shutterstock While you’re likely familiar with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, you’ve probably heard less about type 1.5 diabetes. Also known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), type 1.5 diabetes has features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes . More people became aware of this condition after Lance Bass , best known for his role in the iconic American pop band NSYNC, recently revealed he has it. So, what is type 1.5 diabetes? And how is it diagnosed and treated? There are several types of diabetes Diabetes mellitus is a group of conditions that arise when the levels of glucose (sugar) in our blood are higher than normal. There are actually more than ten types of diabetes, but the most common are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. This leads to very little or no insulin production. Insulin is important for moving glucose from the blood into our cells to be used for energy, which is why people with type 1 diabetes need insulin medication daily . Type 1 diabetes usually appears in children or young adults. Type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune condition. Rather, it happens when the body’s cells become resistant to insulin over time, and the pancreas is no longer able to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance . Unlike type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes still produce some insulin. Type 2 is more common in adults but is increasingly seen in children and young people. Management can include behavioural changes such as nutrition and physical activity, as well as oral medications and insulin therapy. People with diabetes may need to regularly monitor their blood sugar levels. Dragana Gordic/Shutterstock How does type 1.5 diabetes differ from types 1 and 2? Like type 1 diabetes, type 1.5 occurs when the immune system attacks the pancreas cells that make insulin. But people with type 1.5 often don’t need insulin immediately because their condition develops more slowly. Most people with type 1.5 diabetes will need to use insulin within five years of diagnosis, while those with type 1 typically require it from diagnosis. Type 1.5 diabetes is usually diagnosed in people over 30 , likely due to the slow progressing nature of the condition. This is older than the typical age for type 1 diabetes but younger than the usual diagnosis age for type 2. Type 1.5 diabetes shares genetic and autoimmune risk factors with type 1 diabetes such as specific gene variants. However, evidence has also shown it may be influenced by lifestyle factors such as obesity and physical inactivity which are more commonly associated with type 2 diabetes. What are the symptoms, and how is it treated? The symptoms of type 1.5 diabetes are highly variable between people. Some have no symptoms at all. But generally, people may experience the following symptoms : increased thirst frequent urination fatigue blurred vision unintentional weight loss. Typically, type 1.5 diabetes is initially treated with oral medications to keep blood glucose levels in normal range. Depending on their glucose control and the medication they are using, people with type 1.5 diabetes may need to monitor their blood glucose levels regularly throughout the day. When average blood glucose levels increase beyond normal range even with oral medications, treatment may progress to insulin. However, there are no universally accepted management or treatment strategies for type 1.5 diabetes. Type 1.5 diabetes might be managed with oral medications, at least initially. Dragana Gordic/Shutterstock Type 1.5 diabetes is often misdiagnosed Lance Bass said he was initially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , but later learned he actually has type 1.5 diabetes. This is not entirely uncommon . Estimates suggest type 1.5 diabetes is misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes 5–10% of the time . There are a few possible reasons for this. First, accurately diagnosing type 1.5 diabetes, and distinguishing it from other types of diabetes, requires special antibody tests (a type of blood test) to detect autoimmune markers. Not all health-care professionals necessarily order these tests routinely, either due to cost concerns or because they may not consider them. Second, type 1.5 diabetes is commonly found in adults, so doctors might wrongly assume a person has developed type 2 diabetes, which is more common in this age group (whereas type 1 diabetes usually affects children and young adults). Third, people with type 1.5 diabetes often initially make enough insulin in the body to manage their blood glucose levels without needing to start insulin medication. This can make their condition appear like type 2 diabetes, where people also produce some insulin. Finally, because type 1.5 diabetes has symptoms that are similar to type 2 diabetes, it may initially be treated as type 2. We’re still learning about type 1.5 Compared with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, there has been much less research on how common type 1.5 diabetes is, especially in non-European populations . In 2023, it was estimated type 1.5 diabetes represented 8.9% of all diabetes cases, which is similar to type 1. However, we need more research to get accurate numbers. Overall, there has been a limited awareness of type 1.5 diabetes and unclear diagnostic criteria which have slowed down our understanding of this condition. A misdiagnosis can be stressful and confusing. For people with type 1.5 diabetes, being misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes might mean they don’t get the insulin they need in a timely manner. This can lead to worsening health and a greater likelihood of complications down the road. Getting the right diagnosis helps people receive the most appropriate treatment, save money, and reduce diabetes distress . If you’re experiencing symptoms you think may indicate diabetes, or feel unsure about a diagnosis you’ve already received, monitor your symptoms and chat with your doctor.

        "article_text": "Matthew Kapust / Sanford Underground Research Facility Most of the matter in the universe is missing. Scientists believe around 85% of the matter in the cosmos is made of invisible dark matter, which has only been detected indirectly by its gravitational effects on its surroundings. My colleagues and I – a team of some 250 scientists from around the world working on a dark matter experiment called LUX-ZEPLIN (or LZ) – today report our latest findings from the long quest to discover exactly what this dark matter is made of. We have not yet found the elusive particles we believe dark matter consists of, but we have set the tightest limits yet on their properties. We have also shown our detector is working as expected – and should produce even better results in the future. Our results are reported today at the TeV Particle Astrophysics 2024 conference in Chicago and the LIDINE 2024 conference in São Paulo, Brazil. A journal paper will be submitted for peer review in the coming weeks. What is dark matter? When astronomers look at the universe, they see evidence that the visible matter of stars, gas and galaxies is not all there is. Many phenomena, such as how fast galaxies spin and the pattern of the residual glow of the Big Bang, can only be explained by the presence of large amounts of some invisible substance – dark matter. So what is this dark matter made of? We currently don’t know of any kind of particle that could explain these astronomical observations. The central detector of the LZ experiment in an above-ground lab before delivery underground. Matthew Kapust / Sanford Underground Research Facility There are dozens of theories that aim to explain dark matter observations, ranging from exotic unknown particles to tiny black holes or fundamental changes to our theory of gravity. However, none of them has yet been proven correct. One of the most popular theories suggests dark matter is made up of so-called “weakly interacting massive particles” (or WIMPs). These relatively heavy particles could cause the observed gravitational effects and also – very rarely – interact with ordinary matter. How would we know if this theory is correct? Well, we think these particles must be streaming through Earth all the time. For the most part, they will pass through without interacting with anything, but every so often a WIMP might crash directly into the nucleus of an atom – and these collisions are what we are trying to spot. A big cold tank of liquid xenon The LZ experiment is located in an old goldmine about 1,500 metres below ground in South Dakota in the US. Placing the experiment deep underground helps to cut out as much background radiation as possible. The experiment consists of a large double-walled tank filled with seven tonnes of liquid xenon, a noble gas chilled down to a temperature of 175 kelvin (–98°C). If a dark matter particle smacks into a xenon nucleus, it should give off a tiny flash of light. Our detector has 494 light sensors to detect these flashes. Scientists complete building the sensor array for the LZ experiment. Of course, dark matter particles aren’t the only things that can create these flashes. There is still some background radiation from the surroundings and even the materials of the tank and detectors themselves. A big part of figuring out whether we are seeing signs of dark matter is disentangling this background radiation from anything more exotic. To do this, we make detailed simulations of the results we would expect to see with and without dark matter. These simulations have been the focus of much of my part in the experiment, which began when I started my PhD in 2015. I also developed detector monitoring sensors and was responsible for the integration and commissioning of the central detector underground, which began collecting data in 2021. Drawing the net tighter Our latest results show no signs of dark matter. However, they let us rule out a lot of possibilities. We found no traces of particles with masses above 1.6 × 10 –26 kilograms, which is about ten times as heavy as a proton. These results are based on 280 days’ worth of observations from the detector. Eventually, we aim to collect 1,000 days’ worth – which will let us search for even more elusive potential dark matter particles. If we’re lucky, we might find dark matter turns up in the new data. If not, we have already begun to make plans for a next generation dark matter experiment. The XLZD ( XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN ) consortium is aiming to build a detector almost ten times bigger that would allow us to trawl through even more of the space where these ubiquitous yet elusive particles may be hiding.

        "article_text": "Scharfsinn/Shutterstock When we think of a farmer, we still often imagine a man. But in reality, women contribute 49% to real farm income . This isn’t just by increasingly working as farmers themselves. Keeping a farm business going usually relies on women’s off-farm work as well, particularly in times of drought. Despite this, women often do not have ownership of farmland. And when it comes to who gets the family farm in succession planning, daughters, mothers and daughters-in-law are all likely to miss out. There are established legal protections that women can draw on to challenge this. But our recent research finds these are often seen as a threat to the continuity of the family farm, and attempts are made to deliberately lock women out. Australian agriculture only suffers as a result. To fix the problem, some stubborn attitudes will need to change. Passing down the family farm through the generations The process of deciding who will take over the family farm is known as farm transition and succession. Passing down land through the generations is of utmost importance for farming families. Farmers see themselves as custodians of land, building on the work of previous generations for the benefit of their descendants. Farm land ownership is tied to identity, social standing, culture and community. Passing on a viable farm business often relies on keeping it intact, rather than dividing it among siblings. But agricultural land prices have skyrocketed , meaning that for many families, succession planning can be a multimillion-dollar issue. Agricultural land values in Australia have skyrocketed over recent decades. RobynCharnley/Shutterstock Beyond the obvious emotional charge, this also makes it extremely difficult for a sibling who wants to take over the farm to buy out the others. It also can mean siblings who do not take over the farm are giving up more and more money. As you’d expect, this has made farm succession planning big business. Lawyers, accountants and business advisors are all used to help farming families negotiate a way forward. So, who gets the farm? Sons, mostly. The most recent data suggests that daughters only take over the family farm in 10% of cases. But as this data is now quite old, a large upcoming survey will assess whether this remains the case. The default position for most Australian farming families is that a farmer equals a man – their sons are seen as best placed to take over the farm. They are often socialised into this role from birth. Agriculture has undergone a stunning technological shift. Igor Klyakhin/Shutterstock But this view is severely outdated. As farming becomes more professionalised, entrepreneurial and technology-driven , the myth that it requires brute physical male strength is losing power. Fortunately, gender norms in agriculture are slowly shifting . While there is still a long way to go, daughters are increasingly considered as farmers and are less likely to be overlooked in the distribution of family assets. The ‘dreaded’ farm daughter-in-law Few are so mistrusted in the politics of farm succession as the daughter-in-law. Despite this, their on- and off-farm work and their roles as caregivers and community members are crucial to the reproduction of farming families, the family farm and rural communities. Women have become less accepting of being locked out of land ownership as education levels, family law and gender norms have changed. But for the landholding generation, they are still often seen as a threat to the continuity of the family farm. A daughter-in-law’s attempts to start succession planning processes, to raise questions about the underpayment of her partner or herself, or attempts to seek a career outside of rural areas can all also be seen as challenges to the traditional farm family. This is despite the fact she is often just attempting to secure a degree of certainty for her immediate family. Deliberately locked out For some time, Australian family law has extended to de facto partners as well as married partners. In the case of a divorce or intimate partnership breakdown, the court has the power to decide on how property assets – such as farms – will be distributed between the partners. In doing so, it aims to achieve an equitable distribution, rather than seeing assets as owned in a 50/50 split. It may take into account the needs of each partner and their financial and non-financial contributions, such as child care. Despite this, our research found the landholding generation are using the farm succession processes to protect the continuity of the farm from a claim by the daughter-in-law. A range of tactics are sometimes used to exclude women from succession planning. Bacho/Shutterstock This includes delaying transfer of the farm to their adult children, so that the daughter-in-law cannot make a claim on it in the case of divorce. Family business structures that quarantine the farm asset, such as binding financial agreements, are also being used. But collectively marginalising the farm daughter-in-law and excluding daughters from succession is only hurting the industry. In their attempts to preserve the status quo of gender relations, many family farms are failing to prepare for a changing business and social environment. Women have been graduating from agricultural degrees in equal numbers as men for more than two decades. Females farmers have been found to have high levels of entrepreneurship, innovation and strong sustainability values. How can farming families do better succession planning? Australia’s food security and agricultural industry depend on succession being done well. It needs to be a continuous conversation with the whole family, aided by professionals with a range of skills. That means women can no longer be deliberately excluded. As one professional in our study commented: A lot of these girls have sacrificed a lot and … [they] are whip-smart and actually could contribute enormously to these businesses being more successful if [the older generation would] just put fear aside, be clear about what they’re frightened of, deal with it, and move on. If the industry wants to thrive in the 21st century, attitudes will have to change. Lucie Newsome receives funding from the UNE Foundation to support this research.

A daughter-in-law’s attempts to start succession planning processes, to raise questions about the underpayment of her partner or herself, or attempts to seek a career outside of rural areas can all also be seen as challenges to the traditional farm family. And when it comes to who gets the family farm in succession planning, daughters, mothers and daughters-in-law are all likely to miss out.",

        "article_text": "Monika3steps/Shutterstock , CC BY If you’ve ever opened the door to your child’s room only to be greeted by a sea of clothes, toys and who knows what else, you’re not alone. Among countless reminders, pleading and threats, parents often find themselves in battle with their children when it comes to tidying up. For so many of us, it is an endless cycle of “try and let it go” and then “triggered and explode”. The ongoing conflict this creates can be stressful for everyone. But you are not doomed to live with piles of Lego, collected sticks and stones – or rooms full of old food and unwashed dishes until your children leave home. There is a different way to approach this. Why are children and teens messy? There are developmental reasons for children being messy. Children and teens don’t fully develop the part of their brain needed for high-level organisation until adulthood , and can be easily overwhelmed by a tidying job. This should not get them off the hook, though. Practising organisation skills is great for the brain. Research shows helping with tidying up from as early as 18 months is associated with improved prosocial skills (the ability to work with others). It can also be hard to keep a room tidy if children have too many toys in their room. This means they have to riffle through things or tip out toy baskets to find a toy. Too much choice can also lead children to quickly move from one toy or activity to the next. Even teenagers are still developing the part of the brain that helps with organisation (and tidying rooms). Delpixel/Shutterstock , CC BY Why you shouldn’t just clear it up yourself As a parent we can get caught in a cycle of feeling overwhelmed and frustrated and become disconnected from our child’s perspective. For younger children, play is work – much of their learning happens as they play . When we interrupt their play and tidy up their masterpiece, or throw out a special object, it can break trust and feel devastating for them. For teenagers (and even younger children), having personal space is important to develop a healthy identity and sense of control in their world. So when parents barge into their room and move their things, this can feel like a violation. How can make tidying up easier? Make time to talk to your child about tidying up at a calm moment (when you’re not asking them to clean anything). Don’t make it a lecture – acknowledge how hard it is to keep their room tidy, ask for their ideas on what might help and decide together on a regular routine (perhaps they always give their room a quick tidy before TV, or it’s a job on a certain day). Discuss what could get in the way and how you will work together. Have fewer toys in your child’s room and a special place for these. This can make the room more appealing and organised, inspire play and creativity, and make tidying up easier. Having fewer toys in a child’s room and designated spots can make it easier to keep rooms organised. Igisheva Maria/Shutterstock , CC BY Notice moments when your children are doing any kind of cleaning up and acknowledge their efforts. Children love to feel noticed – we all do! Break the task down into smaller parts for older kids. For example, you could suggest, “what about packing all the Lego into that box” rather than just saying “clean up your room”. Be playful with younger children . Cleaning up can be a time for connection. Get them to find all the red toys first, then see how fast they can bring you any socks that need washing. Notice the emotions your child feels when you are asking them to tidy up. See these emotions as an opportunity for connection and guidance. For example, “It’s hard to clean up this amazing fort, you worked so hard on this. I love how cosy it is”. And name emotions as you go. For example, “It’s overwhelming when there is so much to clean. Are you worried about where to start?” Or problem solve together: “What could we clean up first?” With teenagers, use single word reminders , starting with just one thing that needs cleaning (for example, “washing?” Or “plates?”). Single word reminders allow a teen to save face and prevent battles. Watch your tone of voice and body language – try to stay warm, firm and kind.

        "article_text": "Nature moved in when people left the fishing village of Houtouwan in Zhejiang, China Joe Nafis/Shutterstock Right now, human population growth is doing something long thought impossible – it’s wavering. It’s now possible global population could peak much earlier than expected, topping 10 billion in the 2060s . Then, it would begin to fall. In wealthier countries, it’s already happening. Japan’s population is falling sharply, with a net loss of 100 people every hour. In Europe, America and East Asia, fertility rates have fallen sharply. Many middle or lower income countries are about to drop too. This is an extraordinary change. It was only ten years ago demographers were forecasting our numbers could reach as high as 12.3 billion, up from around 8 billion today. For 50 years, some environmentalists have tried to save the environment by cutting global population growth. In 1968, The Population Bomb forecast massive famines and called for large-scale birth control. Now we face a very different reality – population growth is slowing without population control, and wealthy country populations are falling, triggering frantic but largely ineffective efforts to encourage more children. What might a falling global population mean for the environment? Depopulation is already happening For much of Europe, North America, and some of Northern Asia, depopulation has been underway for decades. Fertility rates have fallen steadily over the past 70 years and have stayed low, while longer life expectancies mean numbers of very old people (over 80) will double in these regions within 25 years . China was until recently the world’s most populous nation, accounting for a sixth of the global population. But China, too, is now declining , with the fall expected to rapidly accelerate. By the end of the century, China is projected to have two-thirds fewer people than today’s 1.4 billion. The sudden drop is due to the long tail of the One Child Policy, which ended in 2016, too late to avert the fall . Japan was once the world’s 11th most populated country, but is expected to halve before the end of the century . For now, Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing is one of the busiest in the world. But depopulation is beginning to hit Japan hard. Takashi Images/Shutterstock What’s going on is known as demographic transition . As countries move from being largely rural and agrarian to industrial and service-based economies, fertility drops sharply. When low birth rates and low death rates combine, populations begin to fall. Why? A major factor is choice for women. Women are increasingly having children later in life and having fewer children on average, due to improved choices and freedoms in relation to education and careers . Why are we suddenly focused on depopulation, given birth rates in rich countries have been falling for decades? When the COVID pandemic hit in 2020, birth rates went into free fall for most countries before recovering a little, while death rates increased . That combination bought forward the onset of population decline more broadly. A falling population poses real challenges economically. There are fewer workers available and more very old people needing support. Countries in rapid decline may start to limit emigration to make sure they keep scarce workers at home and prevent further ageing and decline. The competition for skilled workers will intensify globally. Of course, migration doesn’t change how many people there are – just where they are located. Are these just rich country problems? No. Population growth in Brazil, a large middle-income country, is now the slowest on record . By 2100, the world is expected to have just six countries where births outweigh deaths – Samoa, Somalia, Tonga, Niger, Chad, and Tajikistan. The other 97% of nations are projected to have fertility rates below replacement levels (2.1 children per woman). Bad for the economy – good for the environment? Fewer of us means a reprieve for nature – right? No. It’s not that simple. For instance, the per capita amount of energy we use peaks between ages 35 and 55, falls, and then rises again from age 70 onwards, as older people are more likely to stay indoors longer and live alone in larger homes. This century’s extraordinary growth in older populations could offset declines from falling populations. Then there’s the huge disparity in resource use. If you live in the United States or Australia, your carbon footprint is nearly double that of a counterpart in China, the largest overall emitter. Richer countries consume more. So as more countries get wealthier and healthier but with fewer children, it’s likely more of the global population will become higher emitters. Unless, of course, we decouple economic growth from more emissions and other environmental costs, as many countries are attempting – but very slowly . Expect to see more liberal migration policies to boost the numbers of working-aged people. We’re already seeing this – migration has now passed projections for 2050 . When people migrate to a developed country, it can be economically advantageous to them and the adopted country. Environmentally, it can increase per capita emissions and environmental impact, given the link between income and emissions is very clear. As populations fall, countries will compete for skilled migrants. PeopleImages.com - Yuri A/Shutterstock Then there’s the looming upheaval of climate change. As the world heats up, forced migration – where people have to leave home to escape drought, war or other climate-influenced disaster – is projected to soar to 216 million people within a quarter century. Forced migration may change emissions patterns, depending on where people find sanctuary. These factors aside, it’s possible a falling global population could cut overall consumption and reduce pressure on the natural environment. Environmentalists worried about overpopulation have long hoped for global population to fall. They may soon get their wish. Not through enforced birth control policies but largely through the choices of educated, wealthier women opting for smaller families. It’s very much an open question whether falling populations will reduce pressure on the natural world. Unless we also cut emissions and change consumption patterns in developed countries, this is by no means guaranteed.

        "article_text": "Zieusin/Shutterstock Nautical metaphors are irresistible, I’m afraid, when talking about Australia’s seemingly endless submarine saga . But as investigative journalist Andrew Fowler makes clear in Nuked: The Submarine Fiasco that Sank Australia’s Sovereignty , his excellent and excoriating analysis of the genesis of the AUKUS pact , there isn’t much room for levity otherwise. Anyone who doubts the accuracy of former Labor luminaries Paul Keating and Gareth Evans , who have argued that AUKUS is, as Keating put it, “the worst deal in all history”, really ought to read this book. Review: Nuked: The Submarine Fiasco that Sank Australia’s Sovereignty – Andrew Fowler (Melbourne University Publishing) The plan for Australia to acquire eight nuclear-powered submarines, built locally in partnership with the United Stated and the United Kingdom, is projected to cost up to A$368 billion . But it is not just the cost of the AUKUS project that is astounding. While many people should hang their heads in shame, the principal architect of this monumental folly is Scott Morrison, whose reputation will be deservedly further diminished by the revelations contained in Fowler’s carefully researched volume. One question the book does not address in detail is the abysmal quality of political leadership in this country, especially, though not exclusively, on the conservative side of politics. Whatever the reasons for this, the end result was that the huge shift in Australia’s foreign policy alignment was hatched by a Christian fundamentalist former tourism marketing manager with no training in strategic or foreign affairs but a great gift for secrecy and deception. The shift in question was the decision to abandon an agreement to buy much cheaper, arguably far more suitable and deliverable submarines from France, with the aim of “welding Australia’s military to the United States”. In retrospect, it is hard to believe how badly the French were misled, or how shortsighted the rationale for the switch actually was. In Fowler’s view, buying the French submarines would have been a “remarkable achievement”. It would have given Australia “greater independence and a more influential position in the world”. Properly explaining Australian policymakers’ fear of strategic and foreign policy independence would take another book . But what clearly emerges from Fowler’s account is how irresponsible and self-serving Australia’s approach to national security became under Morrison. The fate of the Australian people, not to mention the endlessly invoked “national interest”, was of less concern than short-term political advantage. “The fact that the increasing US military presence in the Indo-Pacific could draw Australia into a conflict,” writes Fowler, “seemed of little consequence in Morrison’s desire to wedge Labour on national security.” Of course, being painted as “weak” on security, and the US alliance in particular, was the stuff of nightmares for the Australian Labor Party. It still is. Consequently, the ALP’s leadership has gone to extraordinary lengths to try and convince voters, and its own increasingly sceptical rank and file , that not only are they equally committed to national security, but that the AUKUS agreement is the best way of achieving it. High costs, significant risks Given AUKUS was the brainchild of a discredited conservative prime minster who, Fowler suggests, “believed he was on a divine mission”, one might have hoped the Albanese government could have at least conducted a perfunctory cost–benefit analysis. AUKUS is the largest single military acquisition the nation has ever undertaken, after all. Recent defence acquisitions have become known for massive cost blowouts and failures to operate or arrive in the advertised manner. But the Labor Party has not only walked into Morrison’s trap; it has willingly, even enthusiastically, “embraced a decision taken after a deeply flawed process”. Even more consequentially, as Fowler points out, “with the major parties in lockstep on AUKUS, the most complex and expensive spend in Australian military history would never be publicly investigated”. At the very least, this is an astounding failure of good governance and accountability. Perhaps even more remarkably, it also demonstrates a singular lack of political judgement, driven by short-term political concerns rather than long-term strategic interests. “Labor lost the one chance it had to identify itself as independent and courageous and put the interests of the country ahead of its understandable desire to win government,” argues Fowler. “The consequences of the fear that drove the ALP leadership to embrace AUKUS with barely a second thought will haunt them for years to come.” Serves them right. When there is little discernible difference between the major political parties on issues of profound national importance, voters – especially the younger variety – may understandably despair about their futures. Even if we put aside the fragile, unpredictable and polarised nature of US politics, it is not too controversial to suggest that the US alliance has some potential frailties and significant costs. Not the least of these is fighting in wars that have no obvious strategic relevance to Australia. AUKUS will further complicate Australia’s relationship with China, our major trading partner. But it carries other significant risks. This not just because, as Opposition Leader Peter Dutton says, it is “ inconceivable ” that we would not fight alongside the US in any conflict with China over Taiwan. If the naval base at Garden Island, just down the road from me off the coast of Fremantle, is not already a nuclear target, it assuredly will be once US and UK nuclear-powered submarines routinely operate from there. Whether my neighbours realise they risk being vaporised as part of our commitment to the alliance and a “ great nation building project ” is a mystery that has not been explored. Local politicians, universities and defence representatives certainly recognise the short-term benefits that may flow from new investment. But this means there is likely to be next to no informed debate about, much less opposition to, the AUKUS pact, no matter what the ultimate costs may be for a nation that can’t even provide adequate housing for its own people. Indeed, the lack of debate, not to say outrage, about the sheer cost of the AUKUS project is perhaps the most remarkable feature of the sorry submarine saga. And that is before we get to the growing doubts about the reliability, deliverability or strategic relevance of nuclear-powered submarines. Perhaps people find technical discussions stupefyingly dull or incomprehensible. Perhaps they don’t realise that if we spend all that money on submarines, not only will our sovereignty and capacity to act independently be significantly eroded, as Keating and Malcolm Turnbull have claimed, but we won’t be able to spend the money on more immediate and tangible threats – repairing our rapidly degrading natural environment, for example. I am not convinced Australia needs to buy any submarines. This will no doubt strike those in Canberra’s strategic bubble as heretical, ill-informed and irresponsible. But it is noteworthy that our overall security did not seem to suffer while the ageing Collins class submarines were unavailable for four years . Even those with widely respected expertise in such matters, such as Hugh White , have cast doubt on the feasibility of AUKUS. White has written that “long delays and cost overruns are certain. Outright failure is a real possibility.” Drunken sailors Fowler has produced quite the page-turner for a book on strategic policy. His account provokes occasional gasps of disbelief, especially about the conduct of the Morrison government and its coterie of carefully chosen, like-minded advisors, many of them from defence companies likely to benefit from government spending. Many former Morrison ministers – as well as Morrison himself – have exited through the revolving door between government and business to take up lucrative positions in the defence industry. Who would have thought? Nuked is worth a close reading to see how Fowler arrives at his damning conclusion: the level of incompetence in the government of Australia was breathtaking, as were the repercussions. The United States would be calling all the shots on what kind of submarines would be sold to Australia, how old they would be, how many there would be, when they would be delivered, and even if they would be sold at all. It was to be expected that Washington would act in its own best interests. What is extraordinary is the possibility that Morrison truly believed that what was best for the United States was best for Australia. Just as extraordinary is the fact that the Labor Party, perhaps fearful of history embraced the deal that made Australia so vulnerable, undermining its independence and sovereignty. Another nautical metaphor about spending like drunken sailors comes to mind. It wouldn’t be quite so galling if the nation’s political leaders weren’t using our money or were motivated by something other than short-term political advantage or the fear of being wedged. The good news, perhaps, is that it is difficult to imagine the nuclear-powered submarines will ever arrive. The bad news is we will still have to pay the Americans and the British to prop up their overburdened and underperforming shipyards in the meantime. With friends like these, who needs to make new enemies? It beggars belief that a country with unparalleled geographical advantages and no obvious enemies thinks it is a good idea to spend $368 billion on offensive military capabilities, which may or may not work or be delivered. Nuked explains how this situation came about. But we may need to ask psychologists why our political leaders have turned us into what the diplomat Alan Renouf famously called a “frightened country” and allowed such follies to flourish.

        "article_text": "Over the years I’ve heard a lot of theories about why the global film industry is so persistently skewed towards men and what can and should be done to fix it. Despite my own best efforts as an activist and an academic , and the collective labour of many others, the position of women, gender-diverse and non-binary people has barely shifted over the time I have been advocating for change — and against some measures it has actually declined. For example, a recent Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film report found the percentage of women directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers working on the 250 top grossing U.S. films has dropped two percentage points from 24 per cent in 2022 to 22 per cent in 2023. And it’s not just Hollywood that sees stagnation or decline with gender equity. \nA recent case study of three film industries that I conducted with colleagues found that gender equity efforts in the industries of Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom  have, in large part, been in vain. It is a galling proposition to repeatedly face political failure at this global scale (and at the same time to feel it so personally). But it’s time to put feelings aside and face the facts from a different vantage by focusing on more viable solutions. Slow progress I worked with a social network analyst, Pete Jones , and a computer scientist, Aresh Dadlani at the University of Alberta , to develop a detailed evidence-based evaluation of the long-term impact of different gender equity policies in the film industry. In collaboration with investigators from Germany and Scotland , our examination of film industries in all three countries under scrutiny showed progress has been piecemeal and painfully slow. Pinpointing how people work together matters for understanding more than just how many women, gender-diverse or non-binary people can be counted in the film industry. (Unseen Studio/Unsplash) Using data from the European Audiovisual Observatory’s Lumiere dataset we created network models of the film industry that allowed us to see who works with whom. We were able to pinpoint which writers, directors and producers occupy the most central positions in each industry. And because the data is longitudinal we can test the impact of past equity policies, and we can also project forward to see how long existing trends will take before they achieve equity. Looking at Canada In the case of Canada, if we just persisted with existing equity policies and did nothing new, basic gender parity (in which men comprise 50 per cent of the industry workforce) will not occur anytime within the next 200 years . Our data showed that the peak Canadian film funding agency, Telefilm , is making a specific impact on one part of the equity picture — the proliferation of all-men production teams. Telefilm funding policies are reducing the number of all-men projects, however most film teams continue to be dominated by men. Significantly more work is needed for Canada to arrive at gender equity in film employment networks within our lifetimes. From ‘What is?’ to ‘What if?’ So if we want a more equitable screen industry, doing nothing, such as letting things evolve “naturally,” or optimistically relying on the unseen handiwork of “market forces,” is clearly not an option. We assessed which of the most frequently used strategies for equity created the most opportunities for women, gender-diverse and non-binary people and/or limited the influence of men in our film industry data models. For example: 1. Fast-tracking more women into the industry. Practically, most film industries, in Canada and elsewhere, lean heavily on this strategy. The “just add women and stir” approach underlies popular policies like providing extra training to advance women’s employment. These initiatives effectively position women, gender-diverse and non-binary people as the cause of their own representational deficit rather than addressing the structural position and behaviours of dominant industry powerbrokers (such as men). Fast-tracking more women into the industry has been a main strategy towards gender equity. (Shutterstock) We found that a slight historical increase in the number of women, gender diverse and non-binary people was not proportional to a decrease in the number of men since the industries had expanded to accommodate a rise across the board. It’s not well known but between 70 and 80 per cent of all newcomers to the film industries we analyzed leave after just one project (the “one and done” syndrome). This, alongside the sheer numerical domination of men, means “just add women and stir” is always going to be a very slow path to equity. Simply giving more women, gender diverse and non-binary people a film credit did not ensure they occupied the central or most powerful positions in industry networks. We measured the top one per cent of the three industry networks from different vantages. In every industry, women, gender diverse and non-binary people were not equitably represented in this industry elite even if their numbers overall increased. 2. No more all-men teams. This strategy is the basis for inclusion-based policies that rely on diversity checklists or quotas — and which often produce accusations of tokenism. Could we advance equity by abolishing all-men teams? We tested this “what if” scenario. All-men movie-making teams are common: 42 per cent of films are made with all-men teams in Canada and the U.K. However, while simply removing all-men teams altogether does reduce the hugely disproportionate representation of men in influential positions, especially in Canada, men still account for 64 percent of people in the Canadian network even after this strategy is applied. What had the biggest impact? “Shadowing” strategies had the biggest impact for opening access to more central, network positions for members of under-represented genders. Shadowing assigns an emerging film professional to an established creative like a producer, director or writer for on-the-job mentoring. Importantly, newer entrants gain not only insights and connections but a film credit. A more focused variation of “just add women,” shadowing seems to change the gender composition of collaboration networks more than other strategies largely because it gives women and other marginalized genders an extra project credit, a huge outcome in an industry in which so many people never get a second chance. This finding suggests policymakers need to focus efforts on ensuring career sustainability for women, gender diverse and non-binary people, rather than directing policy at the point when people enter the field. Many people never get a second chance in the film industry. (Shutterstock) Measuring up Advocates and agitators like me need to change our approach to film industry data to propose more finely tuned evidence-based equity interventions. We haven’t been attentive enough to the collaborative nature of film production. We haven’t used analytic techniques that show the importance of gatekeeping practices for preserving existing power imbalances. We do need to redress a shocking and historically persistent gender imbalance in the film industry. But the solution to gender inequality will depend on ensuring that once women, gender diverse and non-binary people get jobs, they are not relegated to the far edges of the industry’s employment networks.

        "article_text": "While climate change looms large over Democratic politics, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign is keeping its green policies vague, offering few firm positions or clear commitments. This seems like a gamble but, according to research, it may be her smartest political move. Now the official 2024 Democratic presidential candidate, Harris has not yet released a detailed climate policy. Her campaign has mentioned climate change sparingly and has not provided detailed plans on how a Harris administration would address the issue. Research suggests specificity generally signals expertise on key issues and bolsters a candidate’s suitability for leadership roles . In past campaigns, vague policy positions often signalled a lack of seriousness on critical issues. Former president Donald Trump, for example, frequently faces criticism for sacrificing details for broad, emotional appeals . Yet Harris has already secured the approval and even endorsement of key environmental justice groups like the Green New Deal Network , the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund , the Environmental Defense Fund Action Votes , the Centre for Biological Diversity Action Fund and Climate Power Action . Political climate change This marks a significant shift from the Democratic presidential campaign in 2020. At that time, primary candidates faced pressure from environmental groups to provide highly detailed sustainability plans. Candidates competed over action plans, with ideas ranging from practical to innovative. When he secured the nomination, President Joe Biden carried this momentum forward with a set of specific, detailed policy promises. By contrast, the Harris campaign has recently backed away from the policy positions Harris held during her 2020 primary run. A recent campaign statement reversed Harris’s previous position on fracking, a divisive issue in battleground states like Pennsylvania . Though Harris was a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal in the Senate and a strong advocate for its provisions in 2020, she has not reaffirmed her support for the policy in 2024. In her recent appearances, environmental issues have been mentioned only briefly. While her energy policy suggests a general concern for the climate, it doesn’t dive into specifics. Ambiguity is strategy The Harris campaign aims to rally the young voters and liberal Democrats who demanded clear-cut climate policies four years ago. Polls show these groups still view climate change as a critical issue. So why is Harris largely sidestepping the matter? According to several campaign aides, this ambiguity is not a sign of dismissal or inexperience — it’s a calculated strategy. A recent study on campaign rhetoric, taking foreign policy as its example, suggests candidates turn to ambiguity when campaigning on complex and divisive issues. With no single silver bullet to the climate crisis, voters tend to have personal, incompatible opinions on America’s best options. Uniting voters under one clear vision is more difficult than allowing them to fill in their own blanks, for now. Ambiguous, emotional language helps to unite audiences with differing policy opinions. Harris’s tendency to avoid concrete details is more effective than other classic forms of campaign hedging like flip-flopping or ambivalence. A recent study of 14 European democracies suggests when discussing complex or divisive policy matters, the superior campaign strategy is policy vagueness. An opponent that offers a specific policy that exactly matches a voter’s own opinion can be more successful than vague rhetoric, the study shows. However, on topics like green energy policies, no clear consensus exists among the American left. The Harris campaign is seemingly opting for the next best thing. Pointing to patriotism Both the party platform and Harris’s candidacy now frame the fight against climate change as a patriotic duty . In her nomination acceptance speech, Harris emphasized the fundamental freedoms she believes are at stake in this election, including “the freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis.” The political climate has apparently shifted from craving detailed plans to embracing a combative, us-versus-them mentality. In democracies with Big Tent systems — those aimed at appealing to a broad array of voters — political communication is necessarily a strategy of concessions. Candidates, particularly those with progressive platforms, have to navigate the often conflicting demands of their base, swing state voters and the broader electorate. In these scenarios, candidates distil their positions into vague, partisan rhetoric. By attacking their opponents, candidates can provide specificity on one level while avoiding policy detail on another. The official Democratic platform, outlined by Harris at the recent convention in Chicago, reflects this broader trend of using ambiguity to navigate conflicting demands and complex issues. Apparently written with Biden in mind as the anticipated nominee, it offers scant insight into Harris’s green policy intentions. It primarily celebrates the policy victories of the Biden administration, including the sustainability measures in the Inflation Reduction Act . Discussions of the future of green policy centre on the potential harms of a second Trump administration, leaving readers to infer Harris’s stances are starkly at odds with Trump’s. Different shades of green This tactic involves politicians adopting partisan slogans or metaphorical language when addressing the media or speaking on a national stage. That vague language allows them the flexibility to adjust their messaging for different audiences on the campaign trail without appearing inconsistent. In Harris’s case, this ambiguity has allowed media outlets focused on environmental justice to highlight her hardline 2020 positions, while Democratic pundits in battleground states dependent on oil and gas can point to her more recent, less defined policy trajectory . Typically, candidates fill in specifics as their campaigns progress and come under greater scrutiny from the media and political opponents. However, Harris is so far framing this election as a referendum on Trump. As the campaign unfolds, it remains to be seen whether the blanks her voters are being required to fill in on climate action will continue to align with what her campaign is seeking to project, or whether she’ll start providing more detailed information.

        "article_text": "vectorfusionart/Shutterstock What comes to mind when you think of cricket? Perhaps it’s an idyllic scene of an English village green – people sitting on deckchairs and checkered blankets tucking into a traditional cricket tea while  watching mild-mannered players in sparkling whites shouting “howzat?!” every now and then? The stereotype of a genteel , quintessentially English sport can be light years away from the reality, however. In addition to a potentially punishing – and exclusive – working culture, cricket requires a huge amount of endurance, resilience and skill. It’s such a demanding sport, in fact, that test cricket is often referred to as “ the ultimate test ”. Research from Loughbrough University found that a career in professional cricket has “highs and lows that both stimulate a player’s mental health and lead to mental health issues and impaired performance”. Freddie Flintoff’s latest docuseries , Field of Dreams On Tour – a follow up to the original 2022 series for which he formed a cricket team from an unlikely group of teenage boys in his hometown of Preston, UK – is a reminder of the complexity of the sport’s relationship with the mental health of its players. Former international cricketer and coach for the England cricket squad, Flintoff is no stranger to mental health stuggles – and he’s spoken publicly about his experience of depression and his struggle with bulimia during and after his cricket career. The second season of Field of Dreams chronicles Flintoff’s journey as he takes his team on a cricket tour to India, following their ups and downs and showing how sports and cricket can help – and sometimes harm – mental health. Flintoff and his team aren’t the only ones facing mental health challenges. Cricketing history is littered with cases of mental health crises – and even suicide. For over thirty years, cricket writer David Frith researched suicides among cricket players, publishing two books on the issue. His 2001 book concluded that, “cricket has an alarming suicide rate. Among international players for England and several other countries it is far above the national average for all sports”. Nature or nurture Frith believed it was “the loss” of cricket that affected players most – and he could be on to something. A UK study found that “all of the participants reflected negatively on the termination of their career, with a sense of loss and resentment characterising the post-retirement period”. Many elite athletes have a strong but narrow sense of identity – sport is a huge part of who they are . Once athletes retire from sport, they may feel that they lose a part of themselves along with their job. The transition from active player to retirement can be similar to a grieving process . However, a study suggests that risk of depression and suicide can be buffered by a supportive family, which increases players’ sense of identity outside the sport. Elite athletes struggling with their withdrawal from sport can resort to alcohol, drugs and gambling to cope with their sense of loss. A 2023 study suggests that while athletes are not necessarily at a greater risk of suicide than the general population, various factors, such as misuse of performance-enhancing substances, sports-related stressors, sports injuries, drug abuse, affective disorders, mental and physical illness in sport, put them at risk of suicide during active career and retirement. Opening up to close stigma down But the stigma around mental health is slowly being broken down as more and more players speak out about their experiences of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. In response to the death of retired cricketer Graham Thorpe in August 2024, former Indian cricketer Robin Uthappa disclosed his issues with mental health. He said, I recently heard about Graham Thorpe and multiple cricketers who have ended their lives because of depression. Even in the past, we have heard of athletes and cricketers who have ended their lives because of clinical depression. I personally have been there as well. I know for a fact that it’s not a pretty journey. It’s debilitating, it’s exhausting and it’s heavy. It feels burdening. Uthappa is not alone. Retired cricketer Phil Tufnell has spoken about his own struggles with mental health, saying that the national side “didn’t know how to help players battling mental health issues during his career”. Indian international cricketer Virat Kholi has also been open about his mental health during an England tour in 2014 when suffered with the yips . Kholi said: And still to get out of bed and just get dressed for the game and to go out there and go through that, knowing that you will fail was something that ate me up. It just demolished me completely. But not all former players are critical of the sport’s response to players’ mental health. In 2016, former professional cricketer Graeme Fowler spoke about his experience of clinical depression, arguing that cricket is way ahead of other sports in tackling mental health. Support, however, seems to be reactive – it’s provided when there’s already a problem rather than implementing preventative measures for players from the beginning of their career. But the willingness of players to open up about their experiences could be making a difference. In 2022, England test captain Ben Stokes returned from a mental health break. “It was like I had a glass bottle I kept on throwing my emotions into. Eventually, it got too full and just exploded,” Stokes told BBC Breakfast . For example, there are growing mental health initiatives in cricket. The charity Opening Up Cricket was founded in memory of wicket keeper Alex Miller, who took his own life in 2012. While Flintoff and colleagues are doing the hard work of smashing stigma, there is still a responsibility for cricket authorities to create supportive environments that nurture players’ mental health during and after their cricket careers.

        "article_text": "The researchers drilling on the Guliya Glacier. Lonnie Thompson , CC BY-ND As humans alter the planet’s climate and ecosystems, scientists are looking to Earth’s history to help predict what may unfold from climate change. To this end, massive ice structures like glaciers serve as nature’s freezers , archiving detailed records of past climates and ecosystems – including viruses. We are a team of microbiologists and paleoclimatologists that studies ancient microorganisms, including viruses preserved within glacier ice. Along with our colleagues Lonnie Thompson , Virginia Rich and other researchers at the Ice Core Paleoclimatology group at The Ohio State University, we investigate interactions between viruses and their environment archived in ice cores from the Guliya Glacier on the Tibetan Plateau . By linking the genomes of ancient viral communities to specific climate conditions preserved in glacier ice, our newly published research offers insights into how these viruses have adapted to Earth’s shifting climate over the past 41,000 years. The ice cores that preserve Earth’s history are themselves disappearing. Reading history in viral genes We primarily used metagenomes – collections of genomes that capture the total genetic content of all microorganisms present in environmental samples – to reconstruct viral genomes from nine distinct time intervals within the Guliya ice core. These time horizons span three major cold-to-warm cycles, providing a unique opportunity to observe how viral communities have changed in response to different climatic conditions. Through our analyses, we recovered the genomes of the equivalent of 1,705 virus species , expanding known glacier-preserved ancient viruses more than fiftyfold. Only about one-fourth of the viral species we found shared species-level similarities with any of the viruses identified in nearly 1,000 metagenomes previously captured in global datasets. Most of these overlapping species were also from the Tibetan Plateau. This suggests that at least some viruses preserved in the Guliya Glacier originated locally in the region, but it also spoke to the relative lack of glacial viruses in available databases. Using these new reference genomes, we attempted to “read” their stories. One key finding was that viral communities varied significantly between cold and warm climatic periods. The most distinct community of viral species on the glacier appeared about 11,500 years ago, coinciding with the major transition from the Last Glacial Stage to the Holocene. This suggests that the unique climate conditions during cold and warm periods profoundly influenced the composition of viral communities. We hypothesize that these influences were likely due to viruses from other places being blown in by changing wind patterns and subject to selection pressures from changing temperatures on the glacier. Digging deeper, we next determined how viruses interacted with their hosts. To do this, we used computer models to compare viral genomes with the genomes of other microbes also found in this environment. We found that viruses consistently infected Flavobacterium , a lineage of bacteria commonly found in glacier environments. Glaciers are nature’s archives. Puneet Vikram Singh/Moment via Getty Images We also learned that viruses on the Guliya Glacier must “steal” genes from their hosts to manipulate their metabolisms. Encoded within the viral genomes were 50 auxiliary metabolic genes related to metabolism, including the synthesis and breakdown of vitamins, amino acids and carbohydrates. Some of these genes were abundant across all nine time intervals studied, suggesting that they help microbial hosts cope with the harsh conditions on glacier surfaces and thereby improve viral fitness. Thus, viruses not only infect and kill cells, but they likely also alter the fitness of their hosts during infection, in turn influencing their capacity to survive in the extreme conditions of glacier environments. Climate change over time Our findings offer a novel perspective on how life, in the form of viruses, has responded to climatic changes over tens of thousands of years. Understanding these ancient interactions provides a unique opportunity for future research in both virology and climate science. By studying how ancient viruses responded to past climate changes, researchers can gain valuable insights into how viruses adapt to ongoing global climate change. We believe that glacier ice, by capturing information on microorganisms and their ecosystems over time in each layer, remains a critical resource for unraveling the history of Earth’s climate and the life it has supported – especially as glacier ice reserves rapidly diminish .

        "article_text": "Conflict and tension in Nigeria are not new. Ever since independence in 1960 , there have been conflicts over natural resources and political agitations. The country has also experienced a civil war , the Nigerian-Biafran war, and the 12 June 1993 presidential election was annulled – leading to a major political conflict. Peace and conflict studies expert Onyekachi Nnabuihe, in a recent paper , highlights the role of minority groups resisting different forms of domination. How serious are ethnic tension and conflict in Nigeria? Both are serious. Nigeria is a deeply divided state in which major political issues are contested along complex ethnic, religious and regional divisions. Three major identity-group cleavages exist in Nigeria. These are: the competition between the “big three” ethnic groups – Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba competition between these three and hundreds of minorities around the country divisions between the mainly Muslim north and predominantly Christian south. These divisions continually trouble Nigeria and continue to play a role in the struggles for resources. What are the three main causes of tension and conflict in Nigeria? One of the major drivers is the centrist form of federalism. “Majoritarian hegemony ” – the tyrannical dominance of the majority group over others – is a trigger. Another is “ territorial ethnicity ” – the idea (useful for colonial rulers) that certain ethnic groups belong in certain locations. These are triggers for self-determination, secession movements, violent conflict and other forms of organised crime. Recently, there have been debates on Nigeria’s policing system : whether it should be decentralised or not. This draws attention to the question of minorities and the country’s federalism. It is also stimulating quests for state creation. All this creates tension. Sometimes, attempts to safeguard and consolidate one’s identity have turned out to be propellers for tension and conflicts. This was what happened between the Zango and Hausa people in Kaduna State, northern Nigeria, in February 1992. At other times, the perception by minority groups that there is a deliberate attempt by certain majority groups to obliterate a minority identity has led to reactionary resistance and violent conflicts. An example is the Ife-Modakeke crisis which started in the 19th century. Thus, the idea of resistance from minority groups has been a strong driver for conflict in Nigeria. How do majority groups dominate over minority groups in Nigeria? This domination manifests politically and culturally. Often it manifests in fear, suspicion, and perceptions of inferior and subordinate citizenship. It’s also seen in power relations and struggles for resources. “Major” and “minor” ethnicities are locked in struggles for state power and larger access to a scarce resource such as land. An example of cultural domination is the creation of a constabulary in 1886 by The Royal Niger Company. This was created to provide military and police security in areas where the company traded and exercised administrative control. It was amalgamated with other forces into the West African Frontier Force in 1900. Within this force, the British  maintained Hausa as the army’s official language while simultaneously trying to recruit other “martial races” from non-Hausa areas and teaching them to speak Hausa. Colonial officials also created differences in the status of chiefs and emirs in northern Nigeria. These differences continue to shape the hierarchy of chiefs and politics in that region. This action sowed the seeds of cultural domination of minorities in northern Nigeria. Read more: What an irrigation project reveals about farmer-herder conflict in northern Nigeria What has sustained these conflicts for decades? Research has traced the origins of ethnic conflicts in Nigeria to 1914 or even 1900. Conflicts have dominated the political space in the country since the 1950s. Ethnic competition and perceptions of inequality appear to create such conflicts. Also, colonial urban designs and settlement patterns, infrastructure provision in cities, and land struggles are factors fuelling conflicts. Others are ethnic land grabbing, contests for city ownership, and competition for natural resources. How can these conflicts be resolved? It is important to advocate for a true, competitive and developmental federalism. Examples are Canada and Switzerland. Through this, power, resources and long-term developmental initiatives will devolve to sub-national units. Such advocacy requires the combined efforts of political leaders, academics, civil society and the people. Nigeria can devolve more powers to the sub-national units through laws that delegate specific powers and responsibilities to states and local governments. Such include issues like resource control, policing and infrastructure development. Onyekachi E. Nnabuihe received funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York (CCNY) and the Centre for African Studies, University of Edinburgh to conduct research on climate change governance.",

        "article_text": "Punters place their bets on European soccer games. Isaac Kasamani/AFP Betting on soccer games is a popular pastime in many African countries. A 2024 report by GeoPoll found that 76.16% of respondents from Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Nigeria had gambled or placed bets and that soccer was by far the most popular sport to bet on. Young men (aged 16 to 34) make up the bulk of soccer bettors in those countries. Much has been written about the negative aspects of sports betting, including the risk of gambling addiction and becoming involved in money laundering. But, as we show in recent research from Zimbabwe , there are perhaps surprising upsides to the practice, too. We examined how young men in urban Zimbabwe used soccer betting to mitigate the effects of unemployment and to earn an income. We found that, in addition to being a source of income, betting also promotes the adoption of digital technologies among this group. It provides them with an opportunity to learn digital, internet, research, and networking and collaboration skills that they might not have developed in school. This means that what outsiders might view as wasted time is actually being used productively to prepare for the future. The skills our participants learn through soccer betting are useful for finding jobs and in other areas of life. The waiting game In many African nations, young people wait for long periods after completing secondary school and tertiary education before they can get stable employment, earn reliable incomes, acquire assets, start families, and fully transition to adulthood. This is because of poor economic and industrial growth. During this waiting period, (often called “ waithood ”), they engage in various activities , mostly in the informal sector , outside the formal economy and job market. Some continue with their education , hoping that additional qualifications will make them more competitive. Others take jobs in small informal enterprises across different trades, such as music , farming and forex trading , either full-time or part-time. Some start their own small businesses . Read more: Why smartphone gambling is on the up among African millennials Collectively these activities are commonly known as “ hustling ”. The participation of young unemployed people in hustle activities as they wait for better opportunities is well-documented across different countries. In Kenya, for instance, President William Ruto highlighted hustling as a significant economic activity during his Every Hustle Counts campaign in the run up to the 2022 election; the strategy has been credited with securing him the youth vote. What we found Many of Zimbabwe’s young people are also hustling . Our research focused on unemployed men aged between 18 and 38, in the country’s capital city, Harare, and Norton, a town about 40km west of Harare. Some participants had completed secondary school and not gone on to tertiary education; others were university or college graduates. Read more: A South African case study: how to support young job hunters Participants told us that they bet manually and online. Both approaches require current soccer information to make informed bets. This involves analysing various aspects of soccer, including leagues, teams, and players. Most bettors focus on international soccer and rely on the internet for this information. Before placing bets, they research information, such as match fixture dates and times, team/player performance, injuries, and potential line-ups. Bettors rely on information such as soccer statistics, news, and video highlights to make better decisions. They also consult internet sources and social media (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook), watch expert analyses and predictions, and use WhatsApp for information sharing. Additionally, they watch live matches and use websites and applications such as Score808, Hesgoal, AiScore, and Crowd Scores to stay updated on games which they cannot watch. One told us: To be a successful punter, you must have some digital and internet skills. You should know how and where to get information quickly. You should also know how to operate your phone, tablet or laptop; otherwise, without such skills, the devices will not serve you. Devices and skills As this comment suggests, internet access alone is not enough. Though some betting stores provided internet-connected desktops for those without smartphones or internet data, bettors felt it was necessary to have their own digital devices. All our participants owned at least a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer, and products such as power banks, chargers, and portable wifi devices. Some used their betting profits to buy new devices with improved storage memory and battery life. Our participants developed a number of skills while using their devices. These included general device operation, typing, internet usage, retrieving information, downloading and organising documents, images, videos, and audio files. Some bettors took advantage of their existing digital skills to support their betting activities, while others acquired these skills through self-training and consulting with others. One bettor, reflecting on how much he’d learned about the internet, said: Before joining soccer betting, I was unable to use the internet. However, I realised that to successfully bet, I should have up-to-date information, and this forced me to learn how to use the internet. Now I am a pro and I also use the internet for other purposes in addition to betting. Collaboration and networking were a key part of their approaches to betting. Many of our participants used social media, particularly WhatsApp and Facebook, to share ideas and important information. By teaming up online, they divided research tasks and were able to give each other feedback in real time. Not wasted time Our research shows that “waithood” does not automatically equate to wasted or lost time. Young people can use this period to improve and upskill themselves, even in very small or informal ways, as in the case of our soccer bettors.

        "article_text": "South Africa is at a pivotal moment in its energy transition: trying to decarbonise its economy (move away from coal) and make sure that everyone has access to reliable and affordable energy. Storage of renewable energy is very important for this transition. Solar and wind power are not available all the time. To keep the national grid stable, renewable energy must be stored somewhere and supplied reliably. The country has already made strides in integrating renewable energy into its power grid through the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme . Since 2010, this has attracted 110 private independent power projects that have invested R277.2 billion (US$14.6 billion) in renewable energy. But South Africa’s path to a sustainable energy future is complicated by problems with energy storage technologies. As an electrical engineer and researcher , I focus on energy transitions and the various barriers to the renewable energy rollout across sub-Saharan Africa. My recent research investigates the role of energy storage in South Africa’s energy transition. I reviewed all the existing literature on energy storage technologies, policies and market trends in South Africa to determine the overall state of renewable energy storage. I also wanted to find out how renewable energy storage can bring more renewable energy into the national grid, and make the grid more reliable. Different types of energy storage exist. For example, lithium-ion batteries can store energy in various amounts, from small (phone-sized) to large (town-sized), depending on their size and purpose. Pumped storage hydropower is another way of storing energy. This is done by pumping water from a lower dam to an upper dam during off-peak hours, and then releasing it to generate electricity when needed. This is similar to a rechargeable battery but uses water and gravity. Read more: How heat can be used to store renewable energy Thermal energy storage devices which heat or cool substances so the energy can be used later are other options. There are ongoing discussions on the potential of green hydrogen for energy storage . My research found that in the past, pumped storage schemes were a significant part of South Africa’s plans for expanding its electricity generation capacity. However, interest in this form of renewable energy storage has declined. This is mainly because of concerns in the industry that there may not be enough water to make these possible in future. Today, large renewable energy battery systems are seen as the best future option for storing renewable power with South Africa’s state-owned electricity company, Eskom, beginning to set up battery storage . Stuck with carbon Several factors complicate South Africa’s transition to a low-carbon energy system. First, there is a historical dependency on coal due to its abundance and the economic importance of the mining industry . This dependency creates resistance to change , both politically and economically. Second, there is a lack of investment in expanding the national grid. It needs to be upgraded so that renewable energy can be fed into it. Eskom has a massive debt burden . With much of its revenue directed toward servicing debt, Eskom has limited funds available for infrastructure improvements. Read more: Energy storage technology is accelerating – but grids aren't ready for the transition Short-term or inconsistent policy commitments by the government are another problem. These can create uncertainty about the future of clean energy investments, making it difficult for businesses to plan long-term. However, planning must happen. Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, are intermittent and their output fluctuates based on weather conditions and the time of day. To address this, countries like the UK, Germany and the US have set up grid-scale storage: large systems that store electricity for later use. This helps balance the supply and demand on the power grid. Grid-scale storage includes batteries and other technologies such as compressed air energy storage . South Africa, facing similar challenges with renewable energy intermittency, could benefit from adopting these proven energy storage technologies. Incentives, skills, regulation Energy storage technologies, particularly batteries, lower greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, they can drive decarbonisation. But high costs are a problem. The government and private sector must collaborate to create financial incentives and support research and development in energy storage solutions. It is also essential to build a skilled workforce of local expertise in energy storage technologies. Battery storage may be technically able to provide an essential service to the grid. But if no regulations or guidelines explicitly state that storage can provide these services, utilities and market operators may be unwilling to invest in renewable energy storage systems. Regulations are needed to explicitly recognise that renewable energy storage batteries are a key part of energy markets and provide essential services to the grid. Clear guidelines on technical requirements, market participation and compensation mechanisms will enable battery storage to contribute to a more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy system. Policies, partnerships, public and planning First, the government should implement clear and supportive policies that create incentives for investment in energy storage technologies. Tax breaks, subsidies and grants for research and development are globally practised policies that work well. Second, fostering partnerships between universities, research institutions and the private sector can drive innovation and reduce costs. Collaborative efforts can find solutions tailored to South Africa’s unique energy needs. Third, public awareness and understanding of the benefits of energy storage is crucial. Educational campaigns and community engagement initiatives can build public support for clean energy technologies. This will make it easier for clean energy to get wide support. Finally, integrating energy storage into national energy planning is essential. This means making sure that storage solutions are a key part of how the country produces and uses energy, especially in big future projects.

        "article_text": "The United Nations security council unanimously voted on 15 August 2024 to extend the mandate of the 12,626 men and women of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (Atmis) . The African mission has been stationed in Somalia for the past 17 years to support the government’s battle against the homegrown terrorist group al-Shabaab. Despite recent government successes , fighting continues in Somalia. Why has al-Shabaab proved such a hard nut to crack? It’s 18 years since the militant group Harakat al-Shabaab, as al-Shabaab refers to itself, rose out of the disintegrating Somali state. It emerged in 2006 from an existing radical network that lorded it over the capital Mogadishu through sharia courts. Since then it has suffered both battlefield defeats and territorial losses . Yet it remains as strong as ever. In 2012 it joined the al-Qaeda global terrorist network . Al-Shabaab’s strength is estimated at between 7,000 and 12,000 soldiers , making it numerically the strongest organisation under the al-Qaeda umbrella. I am a researcher and author who studies the war economy, security, political Islam and religion and development. My area of focus includes the Horn of Africa. My  book, Horn, Sahel and Rift, the Faultlines of African Jihad , highlights factors that have enabled African jihadists to survive and flourish for decades. Some of these factors apply in the case of al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has grown rich and retained influence, thanks to six main factors. Faulty western doctrine The west and its African partners have focused on the “ hearts and minds ” approach to counterinsurgency in Somalia. Building democratic institutions and democracy is part of this strategy. But these are institutions that don’t always function in a war zone, and fail to have the intended effects. This strategy, along with the focus on military strength, has tended to neglect the security of the local population. Civilians are left to the mercy of bandits and insurgents. Locals are exposed to pressure to supply insurgents, pay taxes to them, and to join them. In many cases, they rely on insurgents for protection in local conflicts. Illegal taxation Al-Shabaab is a revenue collecting machine involved in illegal taxation, smuggling and money laundering. It can do this because its opponents don’t do enough to protect conquered areas or areas controlled by the government.  Al-Shabaab is able to govern and control even areas that are militarily controlled by the state and the African Union mission. The government has mounted a campaign against al-Shabaab taxation in Mogadishu since 2022. It has managed to curtail the group’s electronic money transfer channels by monitoring the business community more closely. The government’s western allies have also helped to crack down on money laundering networks outside Somalia, in Dubai, Kenya, Uganda, Cyprus and Finland. But even these efforts have failed to take the security problems of the Somali business community into account. In this context, the Somali business community will willingly pay taxes to Al-Shabaab. Author Aisha Ahmad has made the point that this money was crucial in explaining how al-Shabaab re-emerged after substantial losses in 2006-2007 and 2011-2016. Protection The group’s reputation as a protector has been built from the start. While al-Shabaab’s interpretation of sharia was harsh, it offered predictability and, in some cases, even protection. Al-Shabaab’s court system produced results. The group’s  ability to implement its policies, and to punish civilians resisting them, added to its influence. Communal rivalries Clans are an important factor in every aspect of life in Somalia. Clans define the relationship between people and all actors in the country, including Al-Shabaab. Clan has become more important for al-Shabaab’s internal and external politics. It has put increased emphasis on wooing traditional leaders and organising them in a national clan shura (consultative council). In some cases, the group has attempted to counterbalance government influence among some clans, and hinder government mobilisation of clan militias. In strategic regions, for example, along al-Shabaab supply routes, clan elders can have a great deal of influence . Clans have been mobilised recently by government to fight al-Shabaab. But support forces from clans can fracture because of clan conflicts, undermining the war on al-Shabaab. Clan conflicts will in some cases also drive clans, and individuals, to ally with the Shabaab for protection. Rural security, including mediation between clans, has not been a part of the approach to fight al-Shabaab. Army weaknesses The Somali army has improved vastly over the last decade and a half. It drives the current offensive and does most of the fighting. An institution that barely existed 15 years ago has today around 19,000 troops.  Of these  8,000 are mobile troops trained by American and Turkish officers. Desertion rates are much lower than they used to be. Training has improved and  soldiers get paid, which wasn’t always the case. But the army still lacks the numbers to launch credible offensives in several regions simultaneously. Its lack of motorisation also limits its ability to shift units from one region to another. This raises doubts about the military support that the Somali army can provide to federal states which are reluctant to face al-Shabaab alone. The Somali army has internal problems to deal with too. These include corruption and clan-based recruitment. The existence of safe areas The core regions that al-Shabaab controls in lower and middle Juba in the southern part of Somalia, as well as in the South West state, have yet barely been touched by the current offensive. Al-Shabaab has held territories in these areas for more than a decade and a half. Its administration structures are well established at a local level. These regions create a hinterland that al-Shabaab can use to rest forces, train new troops, and plan and coordinate operations and propaganda efforts. It is impossible to vanquish the group without taking these territories. What next? The previous patterns of offensives against al-Shabaab  in Somalia highlight weaknesses in both the western and local counterinsurgency strategies.  The result is a relative stalemate. The lessons of the past still hold value for the future – but are often neglected.
